    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>One of the main problems our generation faces is climate change, which is caused by an increase in greenhouse gasses, and it is getting worse by the day. It is impossible to not acknowledge it as a problem, and it is ignorant to not acknowledge it at all. We need to stop the problem of climate change and act fast because if we do not, we will face many problems for years and years to come. The problem is a lot more complex than going all renewable, but we can solve it. This article will look at what impacts climate change can have on our lives and how we can stop it. 
    </p>
    <p>Many people acknowledge climate change as a problem, but many people do not know the risks behind ignoring it. One of the most critical problems is that the sea levels will rise due to climate change, which will lead to flooding and erosion. We already faced many severe floods, but we will face even more if we ignore the problem. But flooding is not the only problem with higher sea levels. With higher sea levels, sensitive ecosystems, like the wetlands and coral reefs, will be damaged. Plenty of animals live in the coral reefs, so losing them will ruin our food chain and our biodiversity. Also, most of our oxygen comes from the coral reefs, so we will lose one of the sources of oxygen which us humans need to breathe. You will see more people with difficulty breathing, leading to more deaths. Additionally, climate change can lead to an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, heat waves, droughts, and floods. Many people will die if we do not act now, and you might even face some of the impacts if you sit around and do nothing. We have seen communities suffer for long periods from natural disasters, but if we have an increased frequency and more severe ones, we will see communities and countries become dysfunctional. Additionally, more carbon dioxide means that the ocean will become more acidic. This will kill many coral and shellfish, which will cause a ripple effect and hurt the food chain. But what might be worse is that our sources of fresh water will become more acidic, and it is at astronomical rates. We need water to live, so that is not good. Additionally, climate change will lead to weather pattern changes and more droughts and heat waves, so areas will go long periods without water, which might lead to more political unrest. The scarcity of freshwater will increase, and we might get to the point where countries will fight over water, like what happens with oil. Another problem is glaciers and arctic ice melting, which will remove habitat for many animals. Also, glaciers are made of freshwater, so it will be harder to access that freshwater. Another problem is that climate change will increase the spread of diseases, and heat-related illnesses, and increase air pollution, causing breathing problems for people. So if you were not scared of climate change, you should be now, but we cannot simply be scared. We need to take action.
</p>
    <p>We need to work together to stop climate change. No one person can stop climate change alone. There are many things that we can do to stop climate change. We need to stop using gas cars and start using electric and hydrogen-powered cars, but that is not enough because the electricity comes from fossil fuels and other nonrenewable energy sources. We need to start getting cleaner energy from renewable sources like solar panels, wind turbines, and other methods. One of the main issues is cost, so we need to start rewarding companies and people to switch to renewables, and we need to put regulations in place. A big reason that many are not using renewable energy is that the efficiency is not that high, so we need to increase the efficiency. Additionally, many countries outside the US are not pitching in. The United States might be reducing the amount of nonrenewable energy that we produce, but it encourages other countries to not, as they can sell it to the US for profit. We need to get everyone aboard on this mission before it is too late. We need to take more drastic measures now.
    </p>
    <p>Climate change is a scary situation. It could destroy us if not dealt with in a proper manner. Some of the key problems that it can cause are a decrease in biodiversity, an increase in health problems, and more natural disasters. It may be hard to observe the problems with our own eyes, but believe me when I say it is there. But we cannot take inaction, as people who do not do anything might be worse than people who cause the problem. There are many ways we can stop the problem, like switching to renewable energy or at least for now, becoming more energy efficient. We can stop climate change together, but everyone will need to pitch in, if we want a chance to save the earth.
