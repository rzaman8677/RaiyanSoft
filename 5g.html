    <h1 class="articleTitle">5G Technology</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="5g.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>5G networks are the fifth and latest generation of wireless cellular mobile networks. It is supposed to have lower latency, several times faster download speeds, support for more devices, and support for real-time applications. It is supposed to be more efficient, increase support for virtual reality and augmented reality, and it is going to increase support for smart homes. 5G was designed to increase efficiency, reliability, and security. It has the power to transform support for the internet of things and increase the reliability and efficiency of machine-to-machine communication. If everything is done correctly, it can transform industries. 
    </p>
    <p>The current problem with 5G is that it is not currently widely available. There are still plenty of areas with 5G support, and it is expensive to implement, so you can imagine why it is not worldwide. A reason that 5G networks are expensive to implement is that it requires new hardware. Cities and countries may need to get new small cell towers and other network-related components to support 5G. Many devices are also not 5G compatible, especially if they are from before 2020, which is the vast majority of devices, so not everyone can experience the benefits. This can give unfair advantages to some companies over others. Another major issue is that with increased connectivity and speeds comes more security vulnerabilities. With more devices using 5G and at higher speeds and higher amounts comes more sensitive data being transferred across networks. This will lead to more data breaches because hackers are aware of the increase of sensitive data being transferred across the network, and see this as an opportunity to steal more data. As 5G is in the early stages, it is susceptible to being intercepted by rogue towers. Rogue towers are fake network towers designed to intercept communication methods. Additionally, some claim that 5G can have negative effects on health. It supposedly increases exposure to radiofrequency radiation, and some also claim that it could interfere with medical devices. Additionally, the cost of devices increases if you want 5G support. These are some of the challenges that need to be dealt with before the worldwide use of 5G networks.
    </p>
    <p>Although there are challenges to implementing 5G, it is worth it. 5G could truly transform various industries. One of the key industries that 5G networks could transform is autonomous vehicles. The big problem in reaching autonomous level 5 vehicles, the highest level of autonomy, is the amount of data that needs to be processed in real-time to ensure safety and improve operations. A key benefit of 5G is more real-time support, so it will allow autonomous vehicles to transmit data in real time. 5G also will allow autonomous vehicles to receive and transmit more data than ever before, and it will be quicker and more reliable than 4G with lower latency. 5G networks will also increase network coverage worldwide and in more places than 4G, so it will help increase operations and safety for autonomous vehicles in areas of bad networks or weak signals. 5G could help autonomous driving become safer to the point that it is safer than real drivers, which could save your life. But the benefits of 5G do not stop there. It also has many benefits in the healthcare field. 5G networks will help improve telemedicine appointments, making them more reliable and available as 5G expands. A big problem for some people in rural areas is a lack of access to medical providers, so it will help if connections in such areas are faster and more reliable. 5G networks will also make communication faster, so it could give medical professionals some extra time, which could be the difference between life and death. The speed of 5G will also help for more accurate and faster clinical trials, so companies can better assess the performance of medicine. Additionally, the technology will allow for real-time data collection and monitoring of patients, so they can quickly act in the case of an emergency or detect a potential problem beforehand. The technology will also make it faster and easier for patients and medical providers to exchange information. 5G technology also creates plenty of new jobs to help keep people employed. Another thing about 5G is the studies done, and it has been determined that it is safe, although there are doubts in many, so 5G is something good. 
</p>
    <p>If we can continue to improve 5G technology and increase availability, we will be able to save many lives. 5G technology can transform the autonomous vehicle and healthcare field. As more and more 5G networks are used, the lower the cost will become. We can also transform many more companies and businesses if we continue to implement more 5G networks worldwide. 5G will make the lives of many easier and lead us to a new and great era of technology.
