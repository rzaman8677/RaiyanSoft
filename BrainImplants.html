    <h1 class="articleTitle">Brain Implants</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="BrainImplants.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Andrew Song</b><br>An aspiring Biology student.</p>
    <p>Brain implants, also known as neural implants, are technological devices that are designed to be connected to the brain and are used to enhance brain function as well as many other purposes. They are a popular concept in modern science, with many companies attempting to create brain implants for military, medical, and entertainment purposes. Scientists are trying to use them to be  a treatment towards many types of conditions, including Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and paralysis.</p>

<p>One of the most common types of brain implants is the deep brain stimulation (DBS) device, which is used to treat Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. DBS devices are typically made up of two parts: a small electrode that is implanted in the brain and a pulse generator that is implanted in the chest. The electrode is used to send electrical signals to specific areas of the brain, and the pulse generator can be programmed to deliver the signals at specific times and with specific intensities. DBS has been shown to be effective at reducing tremors and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease, and it is also being explored as a treatment for other conditions such as dystonia and obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>

<p>Brain implants are being explored as a way to restore or enhance cognitive function. NeuroPace, a commercial-stage medical device company founded by CEO Michael Favet, constructs and sells brain implants to help prevent seizures and epilepsy. It uses a Responsive Neurostimulation device (RNS) to track a patient’s brain activity. It detects potential seizures and sends a brief pulse of electrical stimulation. Despite its incredible capabilities, only a small portion of patients affected by seizures use the RNS System, with only 1,000 patients recorded in 2017 to be using NeuroPace. To put that into perspective, over 65 million people globally are affected by seizures. NeuroPace has a long way to go, but there’s no doubt that they’re making a big step into the right direction in the neuroscientific field.</p>

<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a research and development agency for the United States Department of Defense that explores the development of technology for military use, has attempted to implement brain implants into insects and many other animals. Their goal is remote controlling animals to detect explosives and gather information for them. Surprisingly, some of their experiments have succeeded, such as DARPA controlling cockroaches with impulses it received through the electrodes. It has mostly attempted these experiments on insects, including locusts, beetles, dragonflies, and moths. Whether these insects would be able to survive or even achieve their goal in detecting explosives without being destroyed is unknown.</p>

<p>There are also brain implants that are being developed to enhance human abilities. For example, some researchers are working on developing brain-machine interfaces that can allow people to control devices or machines with their thoughts. These devices work by detecting the brain's electrical signals and converting them into commands that can be used to control the device or machine. While these devices are still in the early stages of development, they have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology.</p>

<p>While brain implants have the potential to offer many benefits, they also come with some risks and ethical concerns. One concern is the potential for the devices to be hacked or manipulated, which could have serious consequences for the person using the device. There are also concerns about the long-term effects of brain implants, as we don't yet fully understand how they will affect the brain over time. Additionally, the cost of these brain implants are unlikely to be cheap, so many people would be unable to afford them.</p>

<p>In conclusion, brain implants are technological devices that are designed to be connected to the brain and are used to enhance brain function as well as many other purposes. They have the potential to offer many benefits, including treating mental health conditions and enhancing cognitive function, but they also come with risks and ethical concerns that need to be carefully considered. As research and development in this field continues, it will be important to carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks of brain implants and to consider the ethical implications of their use.</p>
