    <h1 class="articleTitle">Cloud Computing</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="cloud.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>Cloud computing is an innovative technology changing how businesses operate and interact with data. You have heard of cloud computing if you can read this article. Some of the most common cloud computing services you have used are probably google drive and OneDrive. You might even interact with the cloud every day without noticing. But what exactly is the cloud, and how does it work? This is a good question because the cloud is a vital technology with unlimited capabilities. It gives very promising job opportunities, and it is fascinating. So we are going to dive into the cloud and how it works in this article. We will also go over some of the challenges of the cloud. 
    </p>
    <p>Cloud computing is a technology that provides you with computing services, such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the cloud. All these computing services and hardware are managed by a third party. Your company does not need to deal with any of the hardware aspects or upgrade them. Cloud providers also provide many services and tools. A big reason the cloud is a better option than keeping the hardware yourself is its business model, but we will explore that later. The main cloud providers are Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure. There are three many cloud services: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service(PaaS), and software as a service(SaaS). We will go into detail about these services.
    </p>
    <p>Infrastructure as a service, as the name suggests, provides the customer with the necessary infrastructure, like servers, storage, and networking, over the internet. Infrastructure as a service allows companies to deploy and scale their IT services with ease. Infrastructure as a service mostly provides the hardware services, the infrastructure, for your IT operations with no software tools or applications. Some of the IT tasks that these resources may be used for are to host and run applications, store and manage data, and support other IT operations. This service allows companies to not worry about the hardware and constantly purchase and upgrade their hardware. It allows companies to focus on developing software and other IT operations.
    </p>
    <p>The next service that cloud providers provide is platform as a service(Paas), which is a higher-level service to Iaas. The purpose of a platform as a service is to provide companies with the necessary tools for developing, running, and managing applications and services over the internet. Platform as a service includes a variety of development tools, middleware, software that provides services and components used to connect and manage applications, systems, and services, and databases to make the development process easier and require fewer investments in the hardware and software. Many companies use platform as a service(PaaS) with infrastructure as a service(Iaas). 
    </p>
    <p>The last most prominent service is software as a service(SaaS). Software as a service provides companies with software instead of them developing the software. In this service, the cloud provider manages the software, hardware, and infrastructure required to deliver the service, so you do not have to worry about much. Some of the industries that use SaaS are business, education, healthcare, and government.
    </p>
    <p>Now onto the benefits of the cloud. One of the aspects is that the cloud provides you with on-demand access to tools to speed up your processes. Another principle making the cloud so powerful is scalability. Instead of having to buy more or sell your hardware because you either are not using it or need more, with the cloud, you do not need to worry about that. You can easily use more or less software when you need it. Additionally, one of the main cloud principles is pay-as-you-go which means you pay for the resources you use. This is critical because if you manage your hardware, you would have to pay for all the computing, not what you need. The cloud can also increase accessibility, as cloud services are delivered over the internet. Cloud providers have locations across the world, so you do not have to worry about latency issues due to the server being far away. Additionally, cloud providers usually have disaster control recovery, so if you lose your data, you can get all your data back up to the specified time frame. There are many more reasons why you should use the cloud, but these are the main ones.
    </p>
    <p>But the cloud is not perfect. One of the negativities is that cloud services are internet dependent, so if the internet is slow or down, it will slow down the services. Also, you are responsible for security in the cloud, while the cloud provider is responsible for the security of the cloud, so you still have responsibilities. Another problem is that since the cloud is so new, plenty of applications are not compatible with it. Additionally, there are data concerns, as you are trusting a third party with the data in the cloud provider, and you also lose a sense of control. And many times cloud providers make you locked into them by creating a dependence, so it will be hard to switch. One of the other business issues is that the cost is hard to predict because you pay for what you use, so it is not a fixed cost. Although cloud computing seems good, it is not perfect.
    </p>
    <p>The cloud is a powerful tool that is gaining more steam. It is the future of IT, and it has many benefits. There are issues, however, so we need to be cautious, but it has so much power that it is something that you should explore. It is also a growing field, so if you are pursuing a career, it would be a viable option. The cloud will continue to evolve and help shape the future and maybe yours.
