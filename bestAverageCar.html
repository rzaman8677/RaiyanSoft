    <h1 class="articleTitle">The Best Average Car</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="averagecar.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>The average car price in 2023 is around 50,000 dollars, which is significantly higher than what it was in years past ("Financial"). A big part of this is due to supply chain shortages and increased operating costs. There are many cars out there in the market, but the question remains what is the best average car in 2023? The answer to that is the Tesla Model 3, and it is not just because of the car. In this article, we are going to be exploring other car options to see why the Tesla Model 3 is the best.
    </p>
    <p>The specific Tesla configuration that we are going to talk about is the Tesla Model 3 long-range, which is a little less than 50,000. The Tesla Model Y was a consideration, but the base price is around 5,000 dollars above the average price. First, we have to consider why we are choosing a sedan. The reason is pretty simple. The average household size in America is around 3, so there is no need to have an SUV ("World"). A sedan can more than comfortably seat three or even four people. The reason we are going for an electric car is because of the fuel savings, as it will cost around 4x cheaper to charge an electric car(EV) than a gas car. Although an EV will take longer to charge than to fuel up a gas car, most people do not drive that long distances every day, so you could easily charge from home, so it is more convenient. Let us explore other electric sedans in the market.
    </p>
    <p>There are only three other EVs that can be classified for consideration, and those are the Nissan Ariya, the Toyota Mirai, and the Hyundai Ioniq 5. The Nissan Ariya is only available in California, so it is automatically eliminated. From my experience driving the Nissan Ariya, it is pretty average. It does not feel like an EV but a regular gas car. If you did not tell me beforehand that it was an EV, I would barely notice. It drives okay, but that is all. The software is still buggy, and it is hard to find a charger that works, as Nissan does not have a charging network. The car's driver assistance is decent, but it is not overwhelming. The only car I see having a chance against the Model 3 is the Hyundai Ioniq 5. The Ioniq 5 has all the features the Model 3 has. It has a slightly worse range and does not have AWD unless you pay an extra 3,000, while the Model 3 long range comes with it standard. The car feels and looks like an EV and is smooth to drive, but it is not the fastest. It is a good car, but the Tesla Model 3 long-range gives it no chance. Tesla has a better, more reliable charging network and can use other chargers with an adapter. The Model 3 is way faster and is the smoothest car in the price range with All wheel drive. It also has the best software of any of the cars and has a clean, sleek design. You can also get the car way faster than any other EV in the price range. It is also slightly cheaper than the other options. The build quality is also very good, and you will not see panel gaps like in the older models. It is a 50,000-dollar car but an 80-90,000 dollar car for any other company. Tesla also sells directly to the customer, so the price you pay is the price everyone pays. Other companies are mostly franchise models, so you have to pay 10,000 more usually. Tesla is still years ahead of their competitors.
    </p>
    <p>Tesla has been producing EVs longer than anyone else, so it is cheaper for them to produce EVs than other companies. The Model 3 long-range is worth a lot more than what it costs. It is fast and has amazing software, range, and software. They are also more reliable and have better performance. Tesla also has a better business model than any other company. The Model 3 is also easier to get and faster to get than any other EV. For other companies to compete with the Model 3, they will need to reduce their prices, sell directly to the customer, improve their software, and increase their performance. But this is not considering the fact Tesla will continue improving over time, so it is nearly impossible for any other car company to outpace Tesla. Tesla has too much of a head start over other companies, so they will have the best average car for a long time to come.
