    <h1 class="articleTitle">Deepfakes and their impact on Society</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="deepfake.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>As you might or might not know, deepfakes are videos or images changed by artificial intelligence(AI) algorithms and even machine learning(ML). Deepfakes make it appear as if someone said something or did something, but they may have never done such actions, but deepfake technology can be used to manipulate videos or images to make it seems as if they did. As technology keeps improving, it will become nearly impossible to distinguish deepfakes from real videos and pictures. As of right now, it is already very difficult to distinguish real from deepfakes, but it will continue to get harder. But the real question is why we want or do not want deepfakes and what the future is for them. </p>
    <p>It is immediately easier to determine what are the negatives of deepfake technology. It is especially dangerous in politics, as people campaigning against each other can produce hard-to-distinguish deepfake videos to make their rivals look bad. Deepfakes can lead to a lot of propaganda and cause significant losses. For example, your school rival could create a deepfake video of you cheating on a test, and that could potentially lead to the downfall of your academic career. Or it could be more fatal, such as a video making it appear as if you are saying something bad about a colleague at work. This could lead to retaliation by the other person causing a fight or could lead to you getting fired. Another issue with deepfakes is a security concern. You could try impersonating a high-ranking official of a company, possibly tricking others, and leading them to give you sensitive company data of possibly a competitor. Deepfakes can easily ruin relationships, reputations, harassment, and misinformation. These problems existed long before the technology of deepfakes even developed, so deepfakes do not help the problem. Another question arises with all of these issues. How or do you prosecute people using deepfakes to do some unethical stuff? Can you even incriminate someone for using a deepfake in some cases? Like going back to stealing another company's data, can you be prosecuted if they technically just gave you the information? Additionally, do you punish the company providing the technology to create deepfakes, or do you not? Also, can a court rule on a video even because what if they can not determine it as a deepfake? These are all questions that need to be answered if deepfakes want to have a positive impact on society and stick around.</p>
    <p>Although deepfakes have a decent amount of problems, they provide beneficial uses. Deepfakes can be used for entertainment. For example, you could use a deepfake of someone like Kevin Hart to produce a funny video of one of the jokes you made. This can help shy people show their creativity that they might be too scared to, as they do not have to use their face or voice, although this poses questions about copyright and credit issues. You could also create movies with iconic actors who aged, making it appear as if they are still young, or you can make a young actor look older. Deepfakes can also be used to create educational videos that are more engaging. For example, instead of a regular text-based score, you could have someone like Elon Musk appear as he is teaching the course in video format. This could help students and regular people to learn better. You also might not have the technology to create a video of such high caliber, so deepfake technology can allow more people without the ability to afford the necessary equipment to pursue their passions. Deepfakes could even create more accessibility to content for people with disabilities or language barriers, like adding captions, adding different translations, and even adding sign language versions of videos. Additionally, the technology can be paired with another popular technology in virtual reality(VR). Deepfakes can be used to create more realistic and immersive content. It could also be used to help prepare for natural disaster preparation by creating more realistic simulations of natural disasters. It can also be beneficial for creating realistic medical simulations to train medical personnel for all potential medical issues. Deepfakes might have a lot of issues, but the potential is there.</p>
    <p>Deepfakes are an evolving technology. There is still a lot more that needs to be done to justify everyone being able to access this technology, but there is a tremendous load of benefits, even if a few bad apples manipulate it. Some of the benefits include tutoring uses and enhanced VR experiences. It is hard to determine whether the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but I have some potential ideas to address this issue. As many of you know, ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, has been growing rapidly in publicity. There are a lot of ethical issues with it, but some developers developed a tool to detect whether the content is ChatGPT generated, which can help the problem a little. But for deepfakes, it is going to take more than that. Social media companies need to detect whether the content is deepfake generated and give warnings. There will also need to be regulations for this technology, especially for the legal side. If all of this happens soon, I believe deepfakes are here to stay, outweighing the negatives. </p>
