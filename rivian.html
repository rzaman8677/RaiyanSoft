    <h1 class="articleTitle">Rivian</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="rivian.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>Rivian is an electric vehicle(EV) company founded in June 2009 by MIT graduate RJ Scaringe. RJ Scaringe studied mechanical engineering and manufacturing at MIT, so he is highly knowledgeable in the EV department in both the developing and manufacturing processes, so he should be able to scale production at an astronomical rate. Not to mention, he is also a Ph.D. student. But he cannot propel the company to success alone. That brings us to Rivian's partners, which include some industry leaders such as Amazon, Ford, and Mercedes. The company would end its partnership to develop vans with Mercedes showing how successful they are already, not needing to rely on impressive partnerships. You may wonder what got Rivian to the point where everyone wants them, but they have the luxury of not wanting them back. This is due to their phenomenal products, which include their SUV, the Rivian R1S, their truck Rivian R1T, and their delivery van, the Rivian EDV, sold exclusively to Amazon. The Rivian R1S starts at 72,500 dollars, and the R1T starts at almost 80,000 dollars, so they qualify for the EV tax credit of 7,500 dollars unless you add extra features to get the price over 80,000 dollars. With the average car price approaching 50,000 dollars, Rivians are not that expensive when factoring in the tax credit and the fact it is an EV. Also, SUVs are typically more expensive, and families are willing to pay more for them, as it is crucial for sizable families. Trucks are important utility vehicles for people and adventurous people, so those customers are also willing to pay a little bit of a premium. One of the key features of both vehicles is the off-roading capabilities. They are built to go off-road, and Rivian makes it easy to cook and sleep when camping with some unique add-ons. Rivians also have a lot of horsepowers to make the off-roading experience extra special. Rivians have, from 600 to 835 horsepower, allowing these cars to go from 0 to 60 miles in a little over 3 seconds. Those speeds are extremely impressive for an SUV and truck. Not to mention, these automobiles also have a lot of storage, including a trunk and a frunk, and the truck has some extra storage between the bed and the body. But even with these features, Rivian has an impressive range of about 330 miles, and impressive charging rates, charging up to 80 percent charge in about 40 minutes. But what is an EV without autonomous driving? That is another key selling point of Rivians, as they have autonomous level 3 driving, along with adaptive air suspension for the smoothest drive. The car also has the ability for over-the-air software updates, so the car will improve over time. Electric cars already help the environment, but Rivians are made with recycled aluminum and composite materials. The batteries are also designed to be recyclable, reducing even more negative effects on the environment. The car also comes with all the safety features imaginable and a large infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There is no doubt that the vehicle will sell, but many wonder how Rivian will meet the demands. Rivian went with a different manufacturing strategy than fellow competitor Lucid Motors. They decided to buy a factory instead of creating it from scratch and having to tune everything to maximize production. This allowed Rivian to produce cars right away while Lucid was struggling to produce cars. In the long term, Lucid might be better due to being able to design their factories to maximize performance, but right now, Rivian will fare much better. But Rivan's logic seems pretty good because they should be trying to build a name for themselves and get their vehicles out right away, but time will prove which one is correct. Now going back to the actual production, Rivian produce slightly under 25,000 cars, barely missing their production goal, while Lucid produced 7,180. They both started production around the same time at the end of 2022, so it will be easier to compare these two companies in the long term. But both companies are further ahead than industry leader Tesla was in its first full year. Tesla only produced 2,600 vehicles in its first full year. The last key aspect that allows Rivian to be successful is marketing. They already get free marketing from Amazon and Ford, increasing their reliability, and they also promote their vehicles on social media and through various events and famous individuals. Their main advertising points are their car's unique design, its renewability, its off-roading capabilities, and impressive specifications. Rivian is an impressive company that, without a doubt, succeeds. They are backed by two companies that will ensure they will succeed. The future is bright for Rivian, and it will be a company that you should consider following.</p>
