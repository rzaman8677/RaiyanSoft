      <h1 class="articleTitle">Pros and Cons of VR</h1>
      <img class="articleImage" src="VR.webp">
      <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>A big fan of sports and technology.</p>
      <p>Recently the world has seen an increase in the popularity of Virtual Reality. Virtual Reality uses 3D graphics, embedded stereoscopic lenses, and LED to create a virtual environment that allows users to use their senses in the virtual environment, such as seeing and hearing. Virtual Reality is already being used in various fields, such as entertainment, education, and business, and is projected to grow as the world progresses. But, just like new emerging technologies in the past, VR also has benefits and downsides.</p>
      <h1 class="articleTitle"><u>Benefits of VR</u></h1>
      <dl>
        <dt id="text">Versatility</dt>
        <dd><ul><li id="text">Because of its ability to simulate different environments, VR has the potential and has already proven its ability to be key in the simulation of various fields. For example, doctors are using VR to stimulate health conditions their patients may be experiencing. In the education field, VR will allow students to travel around the world without actually having to go there in reality. </li></ul></dd>
        <dt id="text">Connection</dt>
        <dd><ul><li id="text">With the power of the internet, we can connect with virtually anybody around the world at any time. The ability to talk to someone face to face miles apart is a click away. Virtual Reality takes this to the next level and allows people not to interact face-to-face but also from person to person. It uses virtual senses to simulate an in-person conversation between people using virtual avatars. Like the internet, the user can do this with anybody, and all that is required is a VR headset.
        </li></ul></dd>
        <dt id="text">Deeper Experience</dt>
        <dd><ul><li id="text">There is no other experience like that of putting on a VR headset and entering an entirely new world. VR allows the user to experience an imaginary world like it’s real. VR enables users to see and hear things around them as if they were there. It allows the user to live in a dream-like world, and the experience is like no other.</li></ul></dd>
        <dt id="text">Visually Appealing</dt>
        <dd><ul><li id="text">VR uses visually appealing graphics to allow its users to be anywhere, any time, in the comfort of their homes. These detailed 3D graphics, packaged together with precise sounds, creates an exceptionally elaborate world around them with amazing visuals where you can practically see every nook and cranny in the VR world.</li></ul></dd>
    </dl>
    <h1 class="articleTitle"><u>Downsides of VR</u></h1>
    <dl>
        <dt id="text">Emptiness</dt>
        <dd><ul><li id="text">A large population of VR users reports the feeling of being empty and worthless. These people tend to use VR as an escape from the real world, but this has proved dangerous as users have expressed feelings of worthlessness after spending extended time in VR.  </li></ul></dd>
        <dt id="text">Replacing Reality</dt>
        <dd><ul><li id="text">A problem that can be seen even in today’s internet-driven era is that people are replacing what is actual with what is in the virtual world. VR would only make this worse because, as mentioned before, it creates a realistic virtual world, but it is not the actual world. VR has the potential for users to lose a sense of what is real as they become enveloped in the virtual world and spend less and less time in the real world.
        </li></ul></dd>
        <dt id="text">Addiction</dt>
        <dd><ul><li id="text">Continuing with the idea that a user might get too attached to VR and lose their sense of reality, the user could also get addicted to VR like it is a drug. The feeling provided by VR is the miserable experience previously mentioned in the pros section. The user gets addicted to the non-virtual world and spends less and less time in the real world.</li></ul></dd>
        <dt id="text">Side Effects</dt>
        <dd><ul><li id="text">There have been numerous reports of VR users experiencing side effects such as nausea, dizziness, sweating, and loss of balance. These side effects could lead to more than just side effects of VR if they affect the right person. Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to provide immersive and engaging experiences, but it is not without its drawbacks. There have been numerous reports of VR users experiencing side effects such as nausea, dizziness, sweating, and loss of balance. These side effects can range from mild and temporary to more severe and long-lasting, depending on the individual and the VR experience. In some cases, these side effects can be caused by the VR hardware itself, such as if the headset is not properly fitted or if the motion tracking is not accurate. In other cases, the side effects may be caused by the content of the VR experience, such as if it includes fast-moving or disorienting visuals. In some individuals, particularly those who are prone to motion sickness or have other health conditions, these side effects may be more severe and longer-lasting. While the side effects of VR may seem minor, they can have more serious consequences if they affect the right person. For example, if a VR user experiences dizziness or loss of balance while using VR, they may be at risk of falling or injuring themselves. In some cases, these side effects may also lead to more serious health problems if they are not properly addressed. It is important for VR users to be aware of the potential side effects of VR and to take steps to minimize their risk of experiencing these effects. This may include taking breaks.</li></ul></dd>
