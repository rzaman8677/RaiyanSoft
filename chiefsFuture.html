    <p>The Chiefs are once again Super Bowl Champions. They defeated the Eagles 38-35 in Super Bowl 57. There were plenty of great moments, like Mahomes' heroic comeback after injuring his ankle before halftime, and it was the same ankle that he injured weeks earlier with a high ankle sprain. We also saw Kadarius Toney record the longest punt return of 65 yards, almost netting a touchdown. We also saw touchdowns from Kadarius Toney, Skyy Moore, and Travis Kelce. Juju Smith-Schuster also made some crucial catches in the second half. But the game was not one-sided, as Jalen Hurts had one of the best Super Bowl performances in history, excluding his fumble. But in the end, the Chiefs won, and Patrick Mahomes got his 2nd Super Bowl MVP. Many skeptics labeled this a rebuilding year for the Chiefs, as they traded their best receiver, Tyreek Hill, but Mahomes was still able to lead the Chiefs to another Super Bowl victory despite this. But the question is, is this success duplicatable for the Chiefs? This article will examine why the Chiefs will be able to duplicate this success for many years to come. 
    </p>
    <p>This season has proved that the Chiefs will be capable of having success for many years to come. Even without a number-one wide receiver, Mahomes was able to have his highest-yard season. People said that the Chiefs would go nowhere without Tyreek Hill and that Mahomes was carried by Hill, but all those talks diminished after Mahomes won his 2nd Super Bowl, 2nd Super Bowl MVP, and his 2nd MVP. The defense relied on more young players, and those young players performed under pressure. And on offense, the offense was balanced. The Chiefs had no receiver with over 1,000 yards. Travis Kelce was the only Chiefs player with over 1,000 receiving yards. The Chiefs did all this, with Patrick Mahomes making around 50 million. To recreate this success, the Chiefs will need to follow some simple steps. If the Chiefs can, they should bring back Mecole Hardman on a cheap contract, and they should bring back Juju Smith-Schushter on a similar contract to the one he was on last season. If not, plenty of receivers wanting to win a Super Bowl or increase their value would be interested in signing with the Chiefs for dirt cheap. The Chiefs could even draft a receiver or two through the draft, so they can lock in a receiver for cheaper for 4 or 5 years. The Chiefs do not need to get a superstar as proven by this season. The Chiefs need to get a few solid receivers or a few solid young receivers, and they should be good. The Chiefs' offensive line is roughly set, except they might need to franchise tag Orlando Brown, or they could elect to draft a replacement. With the rest of their money and draft picks, the Chiefs need to worry about their defense. Mahomes can take an ordinary offense with Kelce and make it elite. The only problem that the Chiefs had was their defense. Their defense is not great, but it has been improving. By spending less money and draft picks, the Chiefs will have more money and draft picks to improve their defense. There are not that many things that could stop the Chiefs with a better and younger defense. People will want to come to the Chiefs to play for Steve Spangulo and Andy Reid and to win a Super Bowl. But if the Chiefs can draft some studs, they will be unstoppable. The Chiefs' drafting has been very good over the past years, so do not be surprised to see the Chiefs drafting some stars. Another key to the Chiefs' future success is Isiah Pacheo. He is a bull, and he alleviates some pressure off of Mahomes. He could see his first 1,000-yard season next year, and he will be on the second year of his rookie contract next year, so the Chiefs will not be worried about paying him for the next 3 or 4 years. Those are the main keys for the Chiefs duplicating their success.
    </p>
    <p>The Chiefs can continue using this strategy for as long as they have Mahomes. A large part of this approach will be building through the draft, but the Chiefs should be fine as long as they get some hits like they have been doing. And people will want to sign with the Chiefs as long as Mahomes and Andy Reid are there. That brings us to one potential problem. What do the Chiefs do after Kelce retires, as he is getting up there in age? The answer could be drafting a tight end through the draft, or since they will have an extra cap from Kelce leaving, they could sign or trade for a star tight end. On the other hand, the Chiefs might not have a problem if they draft a star receiver before he retires or if someone like Skyy Moore turns into a beast. Whatever the Chiefs do, they will be in a strong place for title contention for years to come.
