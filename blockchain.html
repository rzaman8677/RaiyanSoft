    <h1 class="articleTitle">Blockchain Technology</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="blockchain.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>With the emergence of cryptocurrencies, you might have started to hear more about blockchain technology and wonder what it is. The blockchain, simply, is a decentralized digital ledger used to record transactions across a network through a network of computers. The technology was originally developed for bitcoin but has transitioned into new uses. A part of blockchain technology is transparency and security. Everyone has access to the same information on the blockchain, so there can be no insider moves, and data cannot be deleted or manipulated once it is in the blockchain. Additionally, the blockchain has no owner, so everyone has equal power and control, preventing tampering and manipulation. Blockchain technology is starting to become a prevalent technology in modern society.
    </p>
    <p>Blockchain technology is starting to be more used in supply chain management. The supply chain is a complex system where transparency, security, and data are critical parts to ensure order. This is why the blockchain is perfect for supply chain management. It ensures that every block of data of transactions is recorded and not mutable to prevent fraud. Blockchain technology increases visibility and increases traceability, ensuring transactions are smooth, and this process is also automated. If there are any issues in the process, the goods can be traced back to their origin and returned if needed. Additionally, the blockchain is secure, so that is the least of the concerns, and you do not need to work with intermediaries, also known as a bank, because blockchain technology enables businesses to streamline supply chain processes. The blockchain allows customers and sellers to connect directly, and it automates payment processing without the need for bankers. Another field that could benefit from blockchain technology is the healthcare industry. One key blockchain technology being used is electronic health records, which allow patients to have complete control of their medical records. They can also decide who can access their medical and how the data can be used. This allows for data to be more interoperable because it can be structured to be organized and easier to read and understand for both the medical provider and the patient. It also allows it so that it is easy for medical providers to access the data, as they only need to be provided access. The data is also in real-time on the blockchain, so it prevents errors if the patient or provider modifies the data. Also, the structure/nature of the blockchain prevents data breaches, manipulation, or any other possible exploits. Another use is for the management of clinical trials, which allows data to be stored in a manner that it cannot be tampered with and remain secure and away from fraud. This is very important, so data is not altered or manipulated to change the accuracy of the trial's results which could lead to harmful results. Imagine you developed a medicine to combat cancer, but the data got changed as if it was effective. This would result in many people being deceived, legal battles, and deaths or injuries. The current way allows for inaccuracies and data manipulation, so blockchain systems could improve the reliability and accuracy of data. Another benefit is that blockchain systems can make it easier for people interested in participating in these trials to sign up and enroll, removing confusion and storing the information in a safe place. And going back to blockchain in healthcare, it could allow patients to send medical information to the research centers, so they could verify if the person is eligible for the trials, improving patient safety and inaccurate results from people eligible. Additionally, blockchain technology should continue to be used by the government to increase the confidentiality and integrity of critical information and increase the transparency of what is happening. Another industry that needs to start using the blockchain is educational institutes. One problem with how academic records are stored is that they are stored with a centralized system, which allows for data breaches, data manipulation, and other exploits. Using a blockchain system, these problems will not suffice, as the blockchain is decentralized, so data breaches, data manipulation, and other exploits will not be possible. Academic records are critical to a student's future, so it needs to be stored with care and securely. It also increases the student's access to their records because, as the system is structured now, you do not have much access to viewing your records. With the blockchain, your institute can provide you with a private key to view your records, simplifying the process. Additionally, it makes it easier for employers to verify your record and its authenticity. This process is automatable to save an unquantifiable amount of time. In addition, it makes the data more available to the student because if you are on a trip out of the area, it is very difficult to access your data without being in person, but the blockchain makes the data easier to access without needing to call anyone. In the traditional system, you would have to call the academic's center with the risk of the data being stolen over the phone, but the blockchain can stop this from occurring. 
</p>
    <p>To conclude, blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize various industries including supply chain management, healthcare, and education to name a few. In supply chain management, blockchain ensures transparency, traceability, and security in transactions, as a result reducing fraud and increasing efficiency. In healthcare, blockchain technology can securely store and manage electronic health records of patients, clinical trial results, and other sensitive information. The decentralized nature of the blockchain eliminates the possibility of data breaches, manipulation, and other exploits. In education, the blockchain can be used to store academic records securely, providing students with easy access to their records and authorizing employers to verify the authenticity of their records. The automation of blockchain processes leads to a significant decrease in time, effort, and cost of tasks. Blockchain has the potential for transforming many other industries as well as making it a promising technology for the future. It will also create plenty of new job opportunities and an up and coming field.
