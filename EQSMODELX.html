      <img class="articleImage" src="EQS.webp">
      <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>A big fan of sports and technology.</p>
      <p>Mercedes is known as one of the pioneers of gas-based vehicles. Mercedes has been developing vehicles since June 28, 1926. Over the years, Mercedes has kept the same reputation as one of, if not the most luxurious car companies in the world, but 2022 and going into 2023 is a different time. Electric cars are becoming the future, and Mercedes has realized that with their EQS SUV, but they are not the pioneers of electric cars because that title goes to Tesla. So the question is, can Mercedes's electric car technology compete with Tesla's? In this article, we are going to be comparing two similar models, specifically the Tesla Model X and the Mercedes EQS SUV. You may be wondering why we are comparing two SUVs, and that is because an SUV is essential to families, the average buyer, and the majority of consumers.</p>
      <h1 class="articleTitle">Business Models</h1>
      <p>Tesla's business model is significantly better. Mercedes uses a franchise business model where they sell their car to various franchises who then sell the car from there. A big issue with this model is that franchises can raise the price as much as they want because they own the cars. There is no point in this model because they could effortlessly sell them direct-to-customer like Tesla. Selling directly to the customer makes it so that all the customers pay the same price, so no one gets scammed by the crazy markups. The only benefit of the franchise model is that it is easier to see the cars in person, but it is not worth the extra cost. That is not the only reason Tesla has a better business model, as they do not use any advertisements, unlike Mercedes. It is complicated to pull off what Tesla has done, but props to Tesla for creating a culture that markets itself along with its CEO's presence. For example, if you go on the biggest social media platform, Tiktok, you will see millions of them about Tesla. Mercedes, on the other hand, does not have as many advertisements from owners of the car on Tiktok, showing how great Tesla is. Also, no one wants to see annoying advertisements trying to sell you a product that further gives a leg up to Tesla. Overall, Tesla has a better business model than Mercedes, but it does not matter if their car is subpar, so let us find out who has the better car.</p>
      <h1 class="articleTitle">Cost</h1>
      <p>There are many factors to determine whether a car is something you would want to buy or not, so we are going to go over most of these factors. To start, we are going to examine the cost. The starting cost of a Tesla Model X is $120,990, according to Tesla, while the Mercedes EQS starts at a significantly cheaper $104,400.</p>
      <h1 class="articleTitle">Exterior/Space</h1>
      <p>Both cars have five seats standard but can go up to seven for an additional cost. The Mercedes EQS has more space than the Tesla Model X, measuring 207.3 inches in length, 75.8 inches wide without mirrors, and 59.5 inches tall compared with the Tesla Model X measuring 184.8 inches in length, 72.8 inches wide without mirrors and 56.8 inches height. You would think with all that extra space, you would have significantly more storage in the EQS, but that is not necessarily true because the EQS has no frunk while the Model X does. It is confusing why Mercedes is doing this because electric cars do not have engines, so what are they doing with this space? But this is not the only questionable part of the car, as the grill of the car is really unique, and a lot of people are questioning it, but Dan from the YouTube channel What's Inside made a good point by saying, "if you are going to get an electric car, you are going to want it to be as unique as possible just because you don't want it to look like all the other gas cars on the road." In my opinion, the car looks good on the outside, but it will take time for people to adjust to it. Another advantage Mercedes has is its roof. The Tesla has an all-glass panoramic roof/windshield, while the EQS has a panoramic roof with shades, so it still has a nice futuristic look, and you will be less likely to get sunburned. If you are a nature lover, you might prefer the Model X, but the Mercedes EQS' roof can open, which is not possible on the Model X. Both exteriors have their tradeoffs, but neither is the wrong choice.</p>
      <h1 class="articleTitle">Interior</h1>
      <p>A big problem with Tesla's interior that gets a lot of complaints is the seats, although looking futuristic, are not comfortable, but that is not the case for the EQS as Mercedes has had a long history of making seats and being known as a luxury company. Also, both cars have cooled, heated, and massaging seats as optional add-ons. Adding to the advantages of the EQS' interior, the EQS is composed of the highest quality materials from Germany with authentic leather compared to the Model X's synthetic leather. The EQS also has voice controls and wireless Android Auto Play and Apple Car Play, while Tesla does not. According to Forbes, the EQS comes with a central 17.7-inch screen and two side screens of 12.3 inches, and a 56-inch hyperscreen is optional. The EQS also optionally comes with two screens attached to the back of the front seat's headrests. The Model X only has a 17-inch screen and another small screen above the steering wheel and has another one even smaller in the console for the back seats. Speaking of the steering wheel, the Model X has a yore steering wheel that is supposedly safer. It will take time to get accustomed to compared to the EQS' regular steering wheel. Finishing the interior section of this comparison, the EQS has ambient lighting that will make the car look more futuristic and fit your vibe. Also, the Model X has no lighting, so the EQS clearly has a better interior.</p>
      <h1 class="articleTitle">Car Specs</h1>
      <p>Now it is time to talk about every car enthusiast's favorite factor, the car stats. We already talked about the price, but what about the speed? The Model X can go 0-60 in 3.8 seconds, while the EQS takes 6.5 seconds. The Model X is significantly faster than the EQS SUV and even the sedan. Another important stat is the range which is important with so many people having range anxiety. The EQS has 305 miles of range, while the Model X has 351 miles, so the Tesla is better if you have range anxiety, but the Model X has fluctuations in range, and there have been updates over the years decreasing the range. Now on to horsepower. The Model X has a 670 horsepower standard compared to the low 329 of the EQS. Now how long does it take to charge the car? According to Solar Reviews, the car charges 142 miles in 15 minutes, compared to 186 miles of the EQS, according to Edmunds, so it helps offset the lower range of the EQS. Additionally, both cars come with dual motor standard, giving all the power necessary.</p>
      <h1 class="articleTitle">Features</h1>
      <p>But what is just as important as stats to a car enthusiast? It is the features of the car. To start off, the Model X has falcon doors, which open like a bird launching2 its wings, while an EQS has regular doors. The falcon doors make it easy to get out of the car in tight spaces. The trunk and falcon doors can open and close automatically from the infotainment system. Another cool thing about the falcon doors is a feature called "light show," which will perform a light show by playing music, opening and closing the doors, and the lights turning off and on. Another intriguing piece of software in the Tesla is the fart feature which makes it seem like you farted by the sound, which the average consumer, a family, will enjoy for fun and games. It also has many other easter eggs in the software that you can find. The Model X also has a "karaoke" function feature perfect for the average family. The Model X also has gaming and streaming services not present in the EQS, which would be nice for long family trips. Another feature the Model X has that the EQS does not have is auto-summon, which will summon the car to drive to where you are standing, so you do not need to find your vehicle in the parking lot. Additionally, the Model X has a better towing capacity, being able to tow up to 5,000 pounds compared to the slightly under 4,000 from the EQS. Both cars feature a bioweapon defense mode, which can filter out dangerous chemicals and gasses. They also both have active air suspension, which will adjust based on the coordinates, and they both have a sentry mode, which acts as a security camera for your car or anything in proximity of the vehicle. You can also change the interior temperature of both of these cars from their respective apps, and both cars get over-the-air updates, making your EV improve over time instead of worsening over time. Both vehicles also come with all the safety features, such as lane assist, blindspot assist, active steering assist, rear cross-traffic warning, and all the other important ones. But one of the key features of these cars is autonomous driving. Although Tesla gets more publicity for its autonomous driving, Mercedes has a higher level of autonomous driving for the EQS. The EQS has level 3 autonomy, while the Model X has level 2, but it does not mean Tesla can not get higher, so Tesla still takes the edge in this category.</p>
      <h1 class="articleTitle">Additional Factors</h1>
      <p>But what about the other factors? Tesla has the best charging network in the world. The EQS relies upon Electrify America, which, although has been expanding quickly and is increasing reliability, is not close to Tesla's self-owned network. Another thing to consider is the build quality which the EQS easily beats the Model X in coming from a veteran car company. A big complaint with Tesla is the build quality with paint coating issues, fit and trim issues, and sometimes are delivered with scratches and dents, but Tesla's build quality has been improving. The EQS, on the other hand, has not shockingly had no complaints coming from a more experienced company. But Mercedes have been known to be one of the highest cars to maintain with all their customized parts, while the simpler Model X has pretty low maintenance.  Another thing to consider is the CEO of the companies, as Mercedes' CEO has not been in the news at all, while Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, has been in the media for some good and bad reasons.</p>
      <h1 class="articleTitle">Conclusion</h1>
      <p>Overall, I believe the better car is the Mercedes EQS SUV for the average customer, a family, as Tesla has prioritized performance, software, and innovation, not to say the EQS does not have innovation. The EQS, by far, has a more comfortable, feature-packed interior. It does not have quite the same performance as the Model X, but the average buyer will not notice it as much. Additionally, the EQS does not have a frunk, but it still has enough space for the average consumer. However, there are disadvantages. The disadvantages for the average consumer are that the software is not as good as the Model X and the charging network is not good, but Mercedes can improve their software, and the EQS charges faster, so it is not the worst tradeoff, especially for the lower price. On the other hand, if you are a car enthusiast, the Model X is your choice with its advanced performance and software. Mercedes is an established company with its old ways, so they are not going to take as radical of risks as Tesla, so for car enthusiasts, the Model X is better with all the risks and new technologies developing. To conclude, both cars are spectacular, so it depends on your preferences, but if we are talking about an investment, it is Tesla. Tesla is a software company, evidenced by its radical risks, while Mercedes is a car company and software companies have more potential, like Apple and Amazon, two of the biggest companies in the world.</p>
