    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Joseph Welder</b><br>An aspiring biomedical engineer.</p>
    <p>Since the early 2000s technology in sports has had a massive impact. From inventions like the radar gun, which is a gun used to measure the speed of a high-speed baseball, to high-definition cameras to capture quality highlights in a game for fans. Recently there has been a massive rise of artificial intelligence in people’s lives, like the tool ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot that is known to help a lot of people in writing. As artificial intelligence continues to grow, so will the likelihood that it will enter the sports industry, and there are many versatile ways that artificial intelligence can be used in the future sports industry. </p>
    <p>Artificial intelligence is already used in sports today and is only becoming more popular. The Sacramento Kings, a team in the National Basketball Association, already use something known as a Connexion kiosk to evaluate players’ health and where they are wearing and tearing. The connexion kiosk, as you probably guessed, uses artificial intelligence to guide players to better health by working in unison with biometric scans. Artificial intelligence also enhances the skill of golf players through the Arccos Caddie. The Arccos Caddie syncs with smart sensors inserted into a golf club and connects to an app that uses artificial intelligence machine learning to gather data to help improve a golf player's swings. Arccos Caddie can gather data on things such as yardages and how far you hit your club through the use of artificial intelligence. The app displays this data and advises that golf players can use the information to improve their game. The Arccos Caddie has tracked over 647,000,000 shots and is still counting to date. Machines like the Arccos Caddie and the Connexion kiosk are only the beginning of a long future of artificial intelligence in sports which is to come. </p>
    <p>Of course, it is hard to plan for the future if you have no idea what is to come. But there are types of technology that will include artificial intelligence and are highly likely to be introduced into the sports industry. For example, sports teams could use artificial intelligence to analyze video data from practices and suggest to the team more efficient training and workouts so that they may work on the identified weak spots in their game. Artificial intelligence could do something similar with video data from previous games and suggest the team plays to use against their opponents based on the video data. Using artificial intelligence to analyze video data would give whichever team is using the upper hand against their opponents and provide them with a more accurate and precise reading than a person might be able to do. Artificial intelligence analytics could also be used in choosing what new rookie player to draft. It costs a lot of money to hire a new player, so sports teams would want to make sure that their choice is the best. Artificial intelligence can analyze a player’s statistics and let a sports team know if their decision is worth it. </p>
    <p>As well as analytics, artificial intelligence could be used as referees in sporting events. During the latest World Cup in Qatar, Fifa used semi-automated offside technology to assist referees in making quicker and more accurate decisions. The technology uses 12 tracking cameras placed underneath the roof of the stadium to track the ball and different data points on the players to calculate their exact positions. Referees would use the data collected by this technology to come to a final decision on things such as penalties. This kind of technology can be enhanced with artificial intelligence in multiple different ways. Artificial intelligence could easily analyze the data itself and decide on its own. The decision would be very accurate, having gone through artificial intelligence analysis. Of course, a human referee would review the decision before it would be confirmed as final. With artificial intelligence, decisions can be done quicker and more accurately as it would be analyzing the data from the data points it collected itself. Having quicker decisions would allow the game to keep going more efficiently instead of having long pauses for referees to decide on an outcome. It would also eliminate possible human bias that a referee might have and that fans have been known to complain about. Having artificial intelligence in referee decision-making would make decisions fairer, more accurate, and quicker. It may be the case that the use of human referees may become outdated in the future, if not soon, as artificial intelligence will have enough power to come to a decision itself.</p>
    <p>Artificial intelligence has incredible potential to be the future of sports technology and will only continue to grow. Implementing artificial intelligence into sports will bring benefits for everyone involved, the athletes, the coaches, the fans, and even the referees. Sports will be changed forever with artificial intelligence, and for the better.
