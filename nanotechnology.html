        You most likely have not heard about nanotechnology, but shortly, you will hear about nanotechnology more often and often. It will soon become a daily part of our lives. Nanotechnology, in simple terms, is the analysis, design, and implementation of materials and systems at the nanoscale level, gauging only nanometers, usually between one to one-hundred nanometers, so nano-scale devices are incredibly small. You will need a microscope to see this technology. Nanotechnology involves an assortment of various STEM fields. Nanotechnology is an intriguing technology with applications in the medical, engineering, and environmental science fields. Nanotechnology will continue to be researched and developed for many years to come with the hope of bringing progress in a multitude of fields. Nanotechnology will help us achieve things that would seem impossible before and will encourage more innovation. It will be a short amount of time before we start seeing nanotechnology daily. We will go into some detail about what makes nanotechnology unique and even briefly go over some fields in which it can be useful.
    </p>
    <p>First, we need to understand how nanotechnology works. At the nanoscale, materials' electrons function differently from their bulk counterparts. You may wonder how this works, and the answer is quantum mechanics. Since nanoscale materials are so confined, they are heavily affected by quantum mechanical effects. In quantum mechanics, waves are described as wave-like entities. In traditional bulk elements, the energy levels are continuous values, as there is plenty of space. But in nanoscale materials, the electrons are confined to such a tight space that their energy level values are discrete, resulting in changes in electronic and optical properties. Examples include increased electron mobility, increased band gap, and the formation of quantum wells and gaps. It might sound surprising that electrons have increased mobility in tight spaces, but it is explainable. In bulk materials, the electron levels are continuous, so it leads to more interactions between electrons. Electrons have negative charges, so they repel each other when colliding, resulting in them being scattered. When electrons are scattered, they lose some energy or change direction. When multiple electrons are scattered, it impedes the flow of electrons through the material, slowing down their movement, especially since there is plenty of space in bulk materials to be scattered. Also, the electrons will gain effective weight, a measure taking into account interactions from the scattering, which makes the electron heavier. Since the electrons are heavier, it will take more energy to move, reducing mobility. Nanomaterials, on the other hand, have discrete energy levels, so they have a lower chance for collisions and scattering, and they have increased mobility, which means more electrical conductivity. They also have increased bandgaps, which is the difference between the lowest and highest energy level, improving electrical and optical properties such as stability and reduced heat generation. The other properties I mentioned are the formation of quantum wells and dots, electrons confined to specific regions, that can make nanomaterials more reactive and increase stability and light emission. To conclude, the benefits of nanotechnology, they have unique properties from bulk materials and can be changed easily.</p>
    <p>There are many fields in which nanotechnology can be useful, but perhaps the most exciting one is electronics. With nanotechnology, you can create much smaller and more efficient technologies. This will especially be useful for computer building, as you may know, how big modern gaming computers can be. Some of the hardware developments are smaller hard drives, nanowires, carbon nanotubes, better display technology like OLEDs and quantum dot displays, and smaller and more efficient transistors to name a few. Nanotechnology is also increasing in use in the renewable energy industry. Companies are developing energy systems with nanotechnology by making new materials to make batteries and supercapacitors. Companies are also using nanotechnology to make more efficient solar panels that can capture more of the sun's energy. Another field that could benefit from the emergence of nanotechnology is quantum computing. Nanotechnology could be used to create materials to ensure quantum bits, quantum computing's version of bits, are stable, so quantum computers can be closer to reaching us. Just picture how life would be with technology more efficient and faster. Would it not be the best? But what is the point of better technology if your life cuts short? That brings us to discuss the benefits of nanotechnology in the medical field. Where a matter of seconds could change your life, nanotechnology can make the technology behind the medical industry faster and more efficient. The few seconds being saved could save your or your loved one's life. Additionally, nanotechnology can be created to kill viruses, cells, and bacteria harmful to the human body. We could create technology to kill cancer cells with the immense potential of nanotechnology. We could also use this technology to create tissues and organs for transplants. There are so many possibilities.</p>
    <p>Nanotechnology is an interesting technology that will be crucial to the development of products in the future. It has immense potential and will solve problems considered unsolvable with bulk materials. We will continue to see the development in front of our eyes and the rapid progress, and soon we will see nanotechnology everywhere. Nanotechnology will help shape the future, and you, too, could be part of that future and perhaps start a career in a related field.</p>
