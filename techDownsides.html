    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Ayush Ghosh</b><br>An aspiring Chemist.</p>
    <p>A big part of modern-day society is the technology used daily and how it shapes the way people live and interact with others. Wherever people go nowadays, people will see some form of technology, even toilets. Technology can be used to do many things that could be good or bad like it could be used to limit freedom or to increase freedom. In modern-day society, it has been used mostly to suppress freedom, similar to 1984. Many of the issues mentioned in 1984 are coming true. 1984’s appendix talks about how freedom is limited through limiting language, preventing people from saying conflicting ideas, which is happening in modern-day society to some extent. However, people nowadays are facing even more ways of suppressing freedom. So while technology is helping humans plenty, it is or can hurt humans just as much. Technology limits freedom by forming thoughts for people, removing choices and the necessity of doing things, and destroying privacy. 
    </p>
    <p>One of the ways that technology has limited freedom is by forming thoughts and opinions for people. There are two sides to every story and sometimes even more, but people nowadays are too lazy to research both sides. People believe what they see first, which is what they will usually only see. A big reason for this is the implementation of artificial intelligence(AI) into everyday life. A big part of AI is data. With data, computers can make recommendations to people, so over time, the more people watch stuff, the more limited the information will be. People will only see the viewpoints that are likely to align with theirs, not the contradicting ones. Or it could be so that people see one viewpoint and then keep seeing that viewpoint, eventually leading to it being their ideas. Elon Musk compares this situation to an anthill, saying, “if we’re building a road and an anthill just happens to be in the way, we don’t hate ants, we’re just building a road” (Musk). This comparison means that AI has a mission, so AI’s only priority is to complete the mission. In modern-day society, the mission of AI is to provide information that people would like or to form thoughts and opinions by targeting people with specific information. And another possibility is that the mission of AI could switch to destroying people by providing them with inaccurate information. People would not be able to know if this is true, as they cannot determine how the algorithms are working, so AI could get rid of freedom without people’s knowledge. For example, AI chatbots like ChatGPT are biased. When asking ChatGPT to write about a political event in the form of a news outlet such as the New York Post, it refused, but when asking the Chabot to write an article in the form of CNN, it gave an article. AI is meant to be unbiased, but it is not, and it is limiting our thoughts by being politically biased. Another way AI Chatbots strip us from our freedom is through inaccuracies. AI Chatbots are not accurate one-hundred percent of the time, so they can provide inaccurate information here and there, changing the way people think or think for people incorrectly. AI is not like a human, as it will never die, so it can continue manipulating people and forming thoughts for people, and limiting freedom. It is similar to the concept mentioned in 1984, where a contradicting thought is "literally unthinkable" (1984). Plenty of things are being censored online to shape our opinions. Like language, AI will not go away like humans, so artificial intelligence can continue to limit freedom for years to come.
    </p>
    <p>Although one of the problems with technology is limiting freedom through thought, it can also limit natural freedom. People cannot choose what to see or choose to see both sides of the story. Even if you turn off seeing recommendations based on search history, people will still see stuff based on what they watched. For example, people could see ads for a political party constantly, even if they turn off recommendations. Additionally, technology limits people from making decisions. For example, autonomous vehicles limit our choice to drive ourselves. Eventually, all vehicles will be autonomous and not feature a driving wheel, so people will be forced to trust the computer, and they will not be able to have the freedom to do things for themselves. This will continue to happen in other fields. People will be forced to trust technology without the option to trust themselves. One of the fields that are seeing this change is supermarkets, where tasks are getting automated, so people are losing the freedom of their job, the freedom of talking to the cashier, and the freedom of not needing to trust technology. Companies are actively supporting matters of limiting the ability of people to do things on their own and limiting what people choose to do. Sure, it might be more convenient, but when there is more convenience, "we shut out other people’s divergent points of view and rest in the comfort of our cluster" (Smith). This quote talks about how technology is limiting creativity. The freedom of creativity is something everyone should have, but technology is limiting this by taking people's jobs and knowledge. This is similar to the principles of newspeak, where people are limited in what they can do, and people like Winston are even tasked with doing nothing (1984). People are losing their freedom to creativity, like in 1984, when people's jobs are to do nothing. Technology severely harms our freedom by limiting what people can think and do.
    </p>
    <p>Another way technology limits our freedom is by taking away privacy. Freedom of privacy is a basic right everyone should have, but that is not the case for anyone with technology. Companies collect people's data without their knowledge and sell it to other companies. It is easy to find information about anyone on the internet. People are constantly under surveillance. People are scared to be creative because anything people do or say will be recorded and viewable by millions. Others can accuse them of stealing work, even if they did not intend to. Many reputations are ruined from past comments surfacing online based on AI algorithms. People do not have the freedom of making mistakes in modern-day society, as they are judged by everything they do and say. Plenty of companies' machine learning algorithms are biased to target security. Someone could have said something thirty years ago, but social media platforms like Twitter might throw it into the feed to make that person seem good. Security is also limited by everything recorded online, so every transaction a person makes can be tracked with technology, such as the blockchain. People are in constant fear that things they say or do can be leaked or distributed. Sure transparency can be good, but it applies constant pressure on people and shapes how people work. These problems are leading to an era where people will lose more freedom, and as the Constitution mentions, if people want security, they will have to give up some rights (Constitution). This is where society is heading. With more security concerns, the government will strip people of their freedoms to provide more security. This problem is much like 1984, where people are constantly under surveillance, and how Winston acts differently because of this(1984). Anything people do and say can be recorded by technology and strip people of their freedom of privacy and making mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>Modern-day society is largely influenced by technology, which affects how people live and interact. While technology can be beneficial, it can also limit freedom, leading to concerns about the suppression of individual rights. A way that technology limits freedom is by shaping people's thoughts and opinions, preventing them from considering multiple viewpoints. Another way that technology suppresses freedom is by limiting natural freedom, such as reducing choices or eliminating the need to make decisions. Technology is also taking away privacy, as people's data is being collected and monitored. All these factors can impact how free people feel to express themselves and make their own choices and can change people's lives. Although most of the stuff I mentioned talks about how technology limits freedom, I, for the most part, still believe that technology is good for society and has more of a positive effect on society. But some things need to be worked on to ensure freedom for those who oppose technology or do not want technology to dictate their lives.
