      <h1 class="articleTitle">Health Effects of being Warrior Fan</h1>
      <img class="articleImage" src="stephenCurry.webp">
      <h5 id="disclaimer" ><b>*Disclaimer: This article is intended to be a joke not to be taken seriously</b></h5>
      <p>Since their great season in 2014, the Golden State Warriors have experienced great adoration from their fans nationwide. The warriors are so adored that you could argue that a big part of their success comes from their fans. But, this adoration from the fans comes at a sacrifice of the health of the fans. For many, their obsession started with the magnificent lightskin legend Mr. Wardell Stephen Curry II, better known as the "Baby-faced Assassin." The babyface's talents and skills are recognized by many but not as much as his fans do. In an interview with young Warrior’s fan Ryen Zahman, he explained how he would “lick the dirt off of Curry’s shoes” if he got the chance. Making matters worse, young Zahman attends his school with a Stephen Curry jersey that he claims is authentic and costs him a whopping five thousand dollars to purchase. In reality, Zahman bought this jersey from Alibaba, but his delusional obsession with Baby-face leads him to believe that the jersey is authentic. After being asked how his mental health has been affected by Mr. Wardell, Zahman responded in a concerning manner. “Steph Curry is him, he is the one, and without Steph, I am nothing, and without me, he is everything. So to answer your question, yes, my mental health is great as long as Steph Curry is in this world.” We have decided to call this phenomenon of obsessing over Curry to no end "Bearing By Curry," or BBC for short.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>Unfortunately, many people like Mr. Zahman suffer from BBC in the United States. One would think this is as bad as it gets, but this is not the case. Along with BBC, Warriors fans suffer from a loss of sleep. Because the Golden State Warriors tend to play late at night, their dedicated fans have to stay up to watch their games which last about two and a half hours. In the case of Ryen Zahman, he stays up almost every day to watch the Warriors play. Mr. Zahman says, “by the time the game is over, it is usually 1 pm, but I will not go to sleep because of the nightmares until around 3 am.” Zahman begins school at 7 am every day, meaning he gets only 3 to 4 hours of sleep on average. A successful student should be getting at least 8 hours so that they can function. Because of this sleep deprivation, Zahman’s grades have plummeted. To put into perspective how bad things are, we decided to interview his computer science teacher, Mrs. Comsy. “Ryen’s grades are to the point of no return, and they are so bad that his grade for my class is a negative 70 percent. In my 50 years of teaching, I have never seen anything like this. His grades make me want to pull my hair off.” Unfortunately, we can not continue our meeting with Mrs. Comsy as she was declared missing the next day.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>To make matters worse, we asked Zahman to describe the nightmares he mentioned he was having and described “being held down to a chair by two fat versions of Steph Curry while I am forced to look into the real Steph Curry’s eyes. Once eye contact is made, I am attacked by images of Steph Curry retiring from the NBA.” We then asked him if he knew why he has this nightmare almost every day, and Zahman responded, “The day Curry retires is the day I retire from life.” Like Ryen Zahman, many Warriors' fans feel the same way and suffer from BBC, sleep deprivation, and nightmares like Zahman. The most we can do for this breed of humans is hope they are not brought deeper into their obsession with the Warriors and Mr. Wardell Stephen Curry II.</p>
