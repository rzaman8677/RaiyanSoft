    <h1 class="articleTitle">James Webb Telescope(JWT)</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="jwt.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>The James Webb Telescope, also known as the JWST, is the predecessor of the Hubble Telescope. It was named after a crew member for the Apollo program, who made significant contributions. The telescope was designed and developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The telescope showcases all our technological advancements and will help us understand the universe. There is still so much to learn about the universe, but the capabilities of the Hubble Telescope were limited due to technology, so the JWST should help us discover important details that we previously could not. This article will explore how the JWST works, its mission, and future implications. 
    </p>
    <p>The JWST uses a combination of optics and scientific instruments to collect and analyze light from distant objects in the universe. The telescope works by reflecting incoming light from objects in outer space onto its scientific instruments. The instruments capture and analyze the light to relay information about the objects observed. The main component of the JWST is the primary mirror, which is made of 18 hexagonal segments that act as a single, larger mirror. The mirror is made of beryllium since it is a durable, lightweight material, making it good against the impacts of space. The job of the large mirror is to collect light from distant objects and focus it on the telescope's scientific instruments. The scientific instruments include a near-infrared spectrograph, a near-infrared imager, and a slitless spectrograph. These instruments work together to capture and analyze light from objects in the universe. The near-infrared camera is considered the main imaging instrument of the JWST and captures images of objects in outer space in infrared light, which makes it easier to observe objects blocked by dust in outer space. The near-infrared spectrograph is used to get detailed spectra of objects in outer space and is capable of observing hundreds of objects simultaneously. It is useful for studying the physical and chemical properties of objects in outer space. And our last main scientific instrument is the near-infrared imager and the slitless spectrograph. The near-infrared imager serves a similar purpose as the near-infrared camera but is designed for more advanced near-infrared imaging, which is why it has a smaller field of view and higher sensitivity. The slitless spectrograph serves a similar purpose as the near-infrared spectrograph but is more versatile, and capable of both imaging and spectrograph, but it is less detailed. The slitless spectrograph does not use a slit to define the portion of the light to be analyzed, like the near-infrared spectrograph. It analyzes the light directly as it enters the scientific instruments. Another key innovation to JWST is its sun shield, which is designed to protect its sensitive instrument from the sun's heat. The sun shield is made of five layers of special materials and is the largest sun shield deployed in space. It is the size of a tennis court when fully deployed, and it was deployed when it reached its orbit at the Lagrange point(L2). Another component of the JWST is the service module, which provides the telescope with the power, propulsion, and communication systems needed for operation. The telescope also has a payload module containing scientific instruments, the primary mirror, and the sun shield. It also has the mechanism used to deploy the sun shield and the primary mirror when the telescope reaches the Lagrange point(L2). Another part is the deployable tower assembly which provides the telescope with the structural support needed to deploy the sun shield and primary mirror. The telescope also contains an observatory module to act as a structural support to the service and payload module. It also includes the thermal control system that regulates the temperature of components. The data collected by the JWST is transmitted back to earth for processing and analysis. The JWST was launched by a European Ariane 5 rocket. The JWST was launched to the Lagrange point, located around 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, because it provides a stable environment free from the interference of the Earth and Moon, and it has a clear view of the sky.
</p>
    <p>The JWST will be used to understand the processes that lead to the formation of stars and planetary systems. It will also be used to find habitable exoplanets with liquid water and life. We are also using it to study the planetary atmosphere and composition, temperature, and weather patterns of exoplanets to determine the conditions that may be suitable for life. The JWST will also study how the universe evolved since the Big Bang, how black holes and active galactic nuclei work, and their significance to how the universe works. The James Webb Telescope will help lead to major discoveries and breakthroughs. It is our top-of-the-line technology, and it will be capable of discoveries that we could not discover with the Hubble Telescope. We are not much farther than the future thanks to the James Webb Telescope and the scientists behind it.
