    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>Neural networks, a subfield of artificial intelligence(AI) and machine learning(ML), are gaining more attention in the academic world, so it is good to understand them. Neural networks are a machine-learning model resembling the structure and function of the human brain, as the name comes from. The human brain is very complex and efficient, showing why neural networks are gaining steam.
    </p>
    <p>Neural networks are a structure of interconnected processing nodes, often called artificial neutrons. They are organized into layers. Each artificial neuron receives input from other neurons, similar to a human brain, and processes the information to determine whether or not the neutron should transmit the signal to the next layer, called propagation. The neurons have weight and biases, determining the properties of the neuron, such as the strength and direction. The goal is to adjust these values to make accurate predictions. The model is optimized after comparing the results to actual data to determine how to change the weight and bias values, also known as backpropagation. Many neural network engineers use 80 percent of the data to train the model and the rest to test the model. The most common metrics used for determining accuracy are mean-squared error and r-squared error. Some also used mean root squared error. One of the most common issues people face is overfitting the data, creating a model where the predicted values nearly map onto the data. The point of neural networks is to make predictions based on the data, not to recreate the data. You do not want to use polynomial regression of a high degree, or you will simply be recreating the data. It might take loads of time to tune the model, but it will result in more accurate predictions. Additionally, many people face the problem of not having that much data to train the model. Training the model is vital for an accurate model. You also have to consider there are multiple factors affecting the data. For example, if you developed an algorithm to determine a healthy breath, there are multiple factors you have to consider, like the frequency of the breath, the duration, and others. Another common issue faced is interpreting the machine's prediction model. You might have difficulty determining how the machine makes a certain prediction based on the model. You can determine how your model works using layerwise relevance propagation(LRP) and feature visualization. Feature analysis, in simple terms, is a technique analyzing how decisions are being made by deep neural networks. It works by generating an input designed to maximize a neuron on a layer in the network. This allows you to determine which classes and outputs are associated with which network. Usually, in this approach, you generate data or an image with random noise and iteratively update the image to maximize a neuron or layer in the network. This approach makes it easy to determine what features the network recognizes and identify patterns or biases in the data. Layerwise propagation is another technique for interpreting decisions made by deep neural networks. In this method, you assign a relevance score and a consistency score to each neuron or layer in the network. The score determines the relevance. This method works by determining the activations for a network based on a given input. Then you propagate back through the layers in the network until you assign a relevance score to every neuron in every layer of the network. This model can help identify biases in the algorithm and give more transparency to the model. It will allow you to understand how the model works. Neural networks are here to stay. Some of the uses for it today are image classification, natural language processing, speech recognition, and times series prediction, which is forecasting a value based on past data. Some of the ambitions that are relying more on neural networks are computer vision, autonomous driving, medical diagnosing, and an exponentially growing list. It is necessary to understand some of the different types of neural networks. The four main types are feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks(RNNs), convolutional neural networks(ConvNets), and generative adversarial networks(GANs). Feedforward Neural Networks are considered the simplest type of neural network. The data flows in one direction without even forming a loop. The input data is processed by a series of layers of neutrons interconnected. The output that represents the prediction made by the model is the output from the final layer of neural networks. RNNs are pretty different, as they are primarily designed to deal with sequential data. The input goes from step to step, but the model has a feedback loop allowing the model to remember previous inputs onto the next step, making it suitable for speech recognition, and language modeling, where remembering previous inputs will be important. It is useful for chatbots such as ChatGPT, which generates responses based on previous entries. Next, we have ConvNets, designed to work with image processing. They have various filters that slide over the input image, looking for patterns or features. It performs element-wise multiplication and summing to create a feature map, documenting patterns and trends from the image. This process is called convolution, hence its name, and it can detect complex features with multiple layers and filters, making it useful for object detection and image classification. Finally, we have GANs which have two parts to them, a generator and a discriminator. The job of the generator is to create artificial data similar to the real one, while the discriminator is supposed to distinguish the fake and real data. GANs can be useful for image generation, creating images similar to images in a dataset, and the same for text generation and music generation. It can also be used for determining discrepancies in data.

    <p>Neural networks(NN) are expected to be one of the most important and continuously growing technologies in the future, without a doubt. With progress in computer processing power and storage, neural networks are becoming more and more refined and capable of new tasks. As the amount of data being collected continues to increase, neural networks(NN) will become increasingly vital in analyzing and making predictions based on this data and even making or assisting in key decisions. Neural networks have already been embraced in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and transportation, and are expected to have a noteworthy impact in areas such as autonomous driving, personalized medicine, and even crafts. Moreover, with the climb of big data and the Internet of Things(IoT), neural networks(NN) will continue to play a crucial role in processing and analyzing vast amounts of data. In conclusion, neural networks are here to stay and will continue to shape the future in many exciting and meaningful ways.
