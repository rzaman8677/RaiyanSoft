    <h1 class="articleTitle">Potential of Men’s Lacrosse</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="lacrosse.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Joseph Welder</b><br>A hard working, first generation American.</p>
    <p>Lacrosse, originally known as "stickball" by Native Americans, has a long and rich history dating back to the St. Lawrence Valley in northern New York, where it was first played by the Algonquian tribe and later adopted by other tribes in the eastern region of North America. French settlers in Montreal eventually discovered the sport and helped to further develop and organize it. In recent years, lacrosse has seen a surge in popularity, particularly at the high school level. The game is played over four quarters, with each team having ten players on the field - three defensemen, three attackmen, three midfielders, and one goalie. The objective is to score as many goals as possible within the given time frame, with the team with the most points declared the winner. If the game is tied after regular time, it goes to sudden death, where the first team to score a goal wins. Teams play extra time in five-minute increments until a goal is scored. If the score is still tied after the first overtime period, the teams continue to play additional five-minute periods until a goal is scored. While the basic principles of the game may seem simple, some various rules and requirements must be followed in order to play the game properly, but once you get these things settled, it is a fun sport to play and watch. However, lacrosse does not just provide an enjoyable and challenging activity for players, but also develops teamwork, camaraderie, and physical capabilities. It has the potential to become a widely popular national sport in the United States and can provide children with opportunities to learn valuable life skills that will be useful in society and improve society as a whole. In addition to its physical benefits, lacrosse can bring people together and foster a sense of community similar to soccer. Although the sport takes a lot of training and dedication, it is a sport worth considering for anyone looking to get involved in a fun and rewarding activity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Lacrosse’s physical requirements to play it professionally are high. Depending on your position, you need a particular build, but you should have strong legs and a powerful upper body. Powerful legs allow a player on midi and attack to use speed to their advantage. Midfielders use their speed to run up and down the field so that they can outrun their opponents to get the ball to the attackmen so that they may score a goal. Defensemen use this same power in their legs, but instead of running up and down the court, they use their powerful legs to follow attackers around the upper half of the field to prevent a goal. They typically have more defined and muscular legs because of this. When it comes to the upper body, all kinds of players use their arms and chest to move around their lacrosse stick with precision, accuracy, speed, and strength. These physical capabilities requirements allow players to stay in shape while learning a sport they love. In addition, lacrosse teaches young men the discipline required for this physique. Basic physical fitness knowledge will inform you of how the required physique requires consistent training and a healthy diet. But, to maintain this consistency, discipline is required, but the sport teaches the discipline needed. Through rigorous training, such as weight lifting and medicine ball workouts, lacrosse players develop good, healthy physiques while maintaining discipline and consistency taught by lacrosse coaches and the cultural parts of the sport itself.

    <br>
    <p>Unlike ping-pong, tennis, and swimming, lacrosse is a team sport, and as a team sport, lacrosse develops camaraderie and teamwork skills. Without camaraderie and teamwork, players cannot play successfully in games. In order to develop these skills, lacrosse drills and practices are together. Of course, this is necessary because it is a team sport, but when done correctly, coaches and mentors can use these drills to develop close friendships. When a player gracefully passes a call to their teammate, it is like communicating without saying anything. Lacrosse teammates can come to an understanding about each other without even talking or knowing how your teammate works, and plays can tell you more than that person probably could about themselves. As well as team drills, lacrosse develops a culture of respectful and truthful comradery. This culture is reflected by coaches developing relationships with their players and teammates developing relationships with each other. Typically coaches make sure that their players are doing well on and off the field by checking up on them. Teammates also check up on each other because they have developed friendships on the court through team drills, becoming closer to each other. These friendships with teammates and coaches help players perform better on the field and have a closer sense of community that sticks with them for life and aids them in maneuvering their way through today’s society.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>By developing comradery, teamwork skills, and a healthy physique for its player, lacrosse and the culture surrounding it helps young men with life skills. Young men can take these life skills learned from lacrosse and apply them to today’s world. Lacrosse has the potential to reach young men not just nationally but internationally, helping many young men develop these skills. </p>
