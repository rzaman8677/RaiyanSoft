    <h1 class="articleTitle">The Impact of Technology on Social Interactions and Relationships</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="TechnologySocialInteractions.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Rayaan Ahmed</b><br>A big fan of dance, art, and medical fields.</p>

<p>Technology has played a significant role in shaping our social interactions and relationships in recent years. From social media platforms to messaging apps and video call software, technology has provided new ways for people to connect and communicate with one another, as well as new challenges and opportunities for building and maintaining relationships.</p>

<p>One way in which technology has shaped our social interactions is through the use of social media platforms. These platforms allow people to connect with others from around the world and share information, photos, and other content with a large audience. Social media has also made it easier for people to stay in touch with friends and family members who live far away, as well as to connect with like-minded individuals and communities (Source: <i>"The Impact of Social Media on Social Interactions,"</i> Psychology Today).</p>

<p>Despite its numerous benefits, the use of social media has also been linked to negative impacts on social interactions and relationships. For example, research has shown that heavy use of social media is associated with increased feelings of loneliness and social isolation (Source: <i>"Social Media Use and Its Relationship to Loneliness and Social Support,"</i> Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology). Additionally, the constant availability of social media can lead to a lack of face-to-face communication, which is important for building and maintaining relationships (Source: <i>"The Role of Technology in Social Interactions,"</i> American Psychological Association).</p>

<p>Another way in which technology has shaped our social interactions is through the use of messaging apps and video call software. These tools allow people to communicate with one another in real-time, regardless of their location. This has made it easier for people to stay connected with friends and family members who live far away, as well as to communicate with coworkers and other professionals (Source: <i>"The Role of Technology in Social Interactions,"</i> American Psychological Association).</p>

<p>However, the use of messaging apps and video call software has also been linked to negative impacts on social interactions and relationships. For example, the use of these tools can lead to a lack of face-to-face communication, which is important for building and maintaining relationships (Source: <i>"The Role of Technology in Social Interactions,"</i> American Psychological Association). Additionally, the constant availability of messaging apps and video call software can lead to an increased expectation of immediate responses, which can be stressful and lead to feelings of being overwhelmed (Source: <i>"The Impact of Technology on Social Interactions,"</i> Psychology Today).</p>

<p>Technology has played a significant role in shaping our social interactions and relationships. While it has provided new ways for people to connect and communicate with one another, it has also presented new challenges and opportunities for building and maintaining relationships. It is important to consider the potential impacts of technology on social interactions and relationships and to find a balance between its use and face-to-face communication.</p>
