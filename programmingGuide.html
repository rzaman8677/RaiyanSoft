    <p>Many programming languages are being used today, but many have trouble figuring out which ones to learn. Although each language is unique has better suited for tasks than other programming languages, there are some better to learn first due to their versatility. The first language I would learn is HTML because although it is technically not a programming language, as it is a markup language, it is the simplest language to get you hooked on programming. With HTML, you can easily see real-world applications, and it is more fun for kids with the ability to see their creations rather than seeing the output in a terminal. After that, people should learn CSS, a styling language, to style their HTML code. CSS will make your website look less bland, and it encourages creativity. Now, after CSS, it is time for actual programming. HTML and CSS are the first things I recommend you learn due to the ability to interact with a multitude of programming languages, so you can showcase your creations. One of the most important languages to start with is javascript, which can help your website be more interactive. It is a little more complex than python, but it is still relatively simple to learn compared to more advanced programming languages, such as C++ and Java. It will also help create an understanding of some important programming languages that will be vital later in your career. There are also many frameworks that you can learn to be able to do other things faster. You may not know what a framework is, but it is like a foundation so that you do not have to start coding from scratch, making things significantly faster than they would be. Some javascript frameworks you should consider using/learning are Angular, React, and Node.js. Before learning these frameworks, you should consider learning jQuery, which many people consider a framework, but it is a library that can make tasks faster. Again if you do not know what a library is, it is simply a collection of prewritten code that you can implement to make the development process faster. After understanding the fundamentals of programming, you should learn SQL. SQL is a programming language that helps you interact with data. Data is very important in the modern-day environment. Data is everywhere, so it is key in any field to understand data and the significance behind it. After learning SQL, I recommend learning PHP, which can help you interact with databases along with SQL, and it can help you process and use data. After this, you have what you mostly need for web development, and you have a pretty strong foundation in programming, so you can go on to learn python and java, and you can use tools such as Spring and Django to showcase your creations to future employers. Java and python will be a breeze to learn, but they are both very useful programming languages, as evidenced by their high usage rates. Python especially will be useful for the data science capabilities with packages such as Scikitlearn, Madplotlib, and Pandas which can also help you get into machine learning. At this point it is a good idea to learn the fundamentals of GIT, which is a version control system, so you can save your code, collaborate with others, and be able to make changes or go back to old versions of your code and much more. GIT is a vital tool for developers, so it is a good idea to learn after all these skills. At this point, you probably do not understand the terminal, so I would recommend learning how to use Powershell, the Command Prompt, and Ubuntu. Again no matter what job you are doing with programming, you need to understand how to use a terminal. In addition to this, you should learn Bash, which can interact with a lot of programming languages and makes tasks simpler. At this point, you should have everything necessary to be a developer or software engineer, but you could also become more advanced by learning C++, which will help create an even deeper understanding of programming. C++ can do almost anything, so it is a very useful programming language. At this point, you should be able to choose which path you want to take in your programming career. If you are interested in game development, you should learn Unity, a platform used to help you create games. If you are interested in robotics, you should learn to use Raspberry PIs, powerful computer that runs Linux that can help you with many tasks. If none interest you, you could continue learning other programming languages, such as Assembly and Rust, or you could try specializing in a programming language. You could even try creating your website. If that is for you, you should learn about cloud and web hosting and how domains and IP addresses work. Programming is a vital tool with high capabilities, this path might not suit everyone, but this is what I recommend. As long as you stay focused and work hard, you will succeed no matter what.</p>
