    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>In this day of age, software engineering is becoming more popular and popular in a tech-driven era. For example, the stock market is dominated by tech companies, especially software companies such as Tesla and Apple. Everywhere you go nowadays, you will see some form of tech, even toilets, especially during the time of this writing with companies like OpenAI innovating with creations, such as ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that can do many tasks from user input, such as writing code for a simple game. In all pieces of tech, there are hardware and software components. Although the hardware is needed, it can only go as far as the software takes. Software engineering is one of the best jobs that you can get in 2023 and can be one of the most enjoyable fields. The field is still growing and could see significant growth in the next few years. Software engineering is fairly future-proof and should be a major year for many years to come. Many of the products created by software engineers, however, might lead to the loss of jobs in other sectors, but they will also lead to various benefits for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>The job title of this field is software engineering, but there are many branches. Typically these jobs have positions such as junior software engineering and senior software engineering. Senior software engineers are the more experienced of the two and are usually reserved for more management tasks. Software engineers typically can work from anywhere since a good percentage of their work is related to writing code in various languages, but not entirely. The working environment can be anywhere with an internet connection, such as your home. This career has many areas of specialization, such as working with artificial intelligence, machine learning, web development, and many other types of software. All of these fields have a focus on developing and implementing software as the name software engineering suggests. A big part of software engineering is planning. You first have to decide what method you want to use for your project development, such as the main two: agile and waterfall. In the waterfall method, you first analyze and find the requirements, design a plan for the software and how to create it, develop, test, and deploy the software and finally maintain the software (Eby). In this method, you do not get the project owner, client, or stakeholders' opinion, as everything is mapped out from the beginning, limiting flexibility (Hooray). Additionally, this model has a fixed start and end date and a fixed budget, further limiting flexibility. Agile, on the other hand, is a more flexible approach than waterfall. A central part of agile is sprints, which are releases/development cycles where you develop parts of the software, not the entire thing at once. Agile starts with requirements. After that, you plan the sprints, develop the specific features, implement the software, and finally review and monitor the software. This cycle will repeat many times for many different sprints (Eby). In the sprint model, you consult with the clients, project managers, project owners, stakeholders, and customers at every stage of this process. In agile, a lot of innovation is allowed so companies can change plans. The budget is also usually flexible due to the constant changing involved in this method. Agile is paired with scrum, a framework for project management. Another big part of software engineering that differentiates itself from programming is documentation, as programmers do not need documentation because they do not need anyone else to understand their code, but software engineers need people to understand their code, so they have to create documentation to help with this. A big part of both of these processes is teamwork because you will have to work with a team to develop software,  meaning communication is another key to this field. This field is not as easy as it sounds. As a software engineer, you have to be good at problem-solving. It might take extended periods to solve problems, so you will have to persevere through these challenges. Another big part of software engineering is improving because software can almost always be improved, so you can not focus on doing stuff the traditional way in this field. You have to innovate and take risks 
    and find a more efficient solution, as efficiency is another aspect of this field. 
    </p>
    <p>In conclusion, software engineering is a field that involves the development and design of computer systems and applications. It is a highly technical and complex field that requires a deep understanding of programming languages and attentiveness to detail, persistence, and courage. Software engineers play a crucial role in the creation of new technology and the advancement of computer systems. Their work allows individuals and organizations to accomplish tasks more efficiently and effectively, making a significant impact on our daily lives and gearing us for the future.
