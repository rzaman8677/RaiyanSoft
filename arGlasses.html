    <p>You most likely have heard about virtual reality, also known as VR. It is considered by many to be the future. But a big problem I see with VR is that it disconnects you from reality. After all, it is called virtual reality. But what if I told you that this problem is solvable? But even crazier, what if I told you that the problem has already been fixed by technology out in the market? That technology is called AR, also known as augmented reality. To augment something means to add on something, so augmented reality adds to reality instead of creating a new reality like VR. AR is a similar concept to VR, but you can still see the real world, and you can also see the things you would see in VR, but added on. I believe that AR is the future and not VR. 
    </p>
    <p>If you have an iPhone or follow Apple, there is a good chance you have heard about AR. There are some basic AR apps, like furniture apps, where you can visualize what furniture would look like in your room, but this is fairly basic AR. AR can have much more potential than VR if done correctly. Apple and Google had similar thoughts when they were working on AR glasses, but they have since held off on their plans. But I believe they stopped working on these glasses because it is not easy to make. AR glasses are made in the format of a pair of glasses, not an entire headset like VR, so it is hard to make with less space. There are only a few AR glasses on the market, like NReal and Rokid. These glasses do not have good battery life. They are also easy to distinguish, so the technology needs plenty of work, but let us go over why it could be worth it for you.
    </p>
    <p>First, to understand why augmented reality glasses are worth it, we need to understand how the technology works. AR glasses have cameras to capture images, sensors for detecting the user's head position, and microphones for audio. The glasses first analyze the environment around them. They then use an algorithm to process the data to determine where to place the digital information that is going to be displayed to the user. After this, the glasses use a display in front of the users' eyes. The display is transparent, allowing you to see the environment around you, and you can also see the digital information overlaid over the real world. To search for information, you can use voice commands, haptics, or your phone. AR technology has more steps than VR, as it requires the collection of more data, more processing, and decision-making, a similar problem to developing advanced autonomous cars. The technology can be very expensive to create, and it will take a lot more development. But even after this, I believe that AR is the future. 
    </p>
    <p>There are many benefits to augmented reality. One of the uses that could revolutionize the industry is in the medical field. Sure, you can use VR to simulate medical operations, but VR technology does not give you a sense of touch and weight. Some technologies attempt to, but none are that advanced, and they are too expensive. With AR, it overlays information to the real world, so you could practice a medical operation on a dummy, so you have a sense of how careful you need to be and a sense of realism. You could also use these glasses during an operation, so if you need help, you can visualize it while also seeing your patient. VR technology blocks reality, so you cannot use it during an operation, or you would not be able to see your patient. This would also similarly help engineers and astronauts. It could also help sports players like you could use the glasses to visualize a defender blocking your vision when you are going for a shot in basketball. It would also make games more realistic. You could use your bed as a racing car, and you could use a basketball playing NBA 2K. You could even use them for cooking like you could watch someone show you how to cook something while you are cooking. No need to watch a YouTube video and then cook, as you can do both simultaneously. In addition, it would not be difficult to implement VR in AR glasses, as you can use a simple cover to make them into VR glasses as NReal did. The limits of AR are way higher than VR, and you can use them without needing to take them off while doing all your daily tasks. AR glasses have immense potential and could help transform various industries and make your life much easier.
