    <h1 class="articleTitle">Saudi's Line City</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="linecity.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>Saudi Arabia, also known as the oil king, is trying to diversify their economy away from just gas. They are investing in more renewable energy. For example, one of their biggest investments was Lucid Motors, an electric car company. But the main project for Saudi is something much bigger, the Saudi Line City. The Saudi Line City is going to be an ultra-modern city that houses over one million people and is over one hundred miles in length. It is going to be located in the middle of a desert. The city is going to be tech-packed and powered by renewable energy to help diversify Saudi’s economy. If done successfully, it will be the first zero-carbon city in the world. </p>
    <p>The city is an innovative project that has never been done before. It has a lot of promise and can revolutionize the future of cities for many years. One of the key benefits of this city is renewable energy and sustainability. One of the key ways that this city is going to do this is by autonomous vehicles and high-speed trains. That is why Saudi is investing loads of money in electric car companies like Lucid, which promises futuristic vehicles that use renewable energy and have the capability of being autonomous. They also plan to use high-speed trains, so people have an option for public transportation without the need to worry about traffic. This should also make transportation safer. Another key to making the city renewable and sustainable is its smart buildings. These buildings will be energy efficient with sensors, automation systems, and other technologies to optimize energy usage. For instance, these buildings will use smart lighting, automatically adjusting based on natural light, and the building’s heating and cooling system will automatically turn off if no one is in the room, and it will also ensure the reduction of the spread of allergens. The buildings will also have amazing ventilation systems to ensure the air quality is pristine. Another key feature is that the buildings will collect a lot of data from sensors, so it can detect how the building can be improved or maintained. The buildings will also have extremely fast WiFi and voice assistants. Another key to these buildings is security. The buildings will have a lot of surveillance systems and biometric authentication systems to ensure the people in the building are safe. And most importantly, the buildings will be powered by renewable energy: solar energy, wind energy, and others. Another key to the city is the well-being of the people. The city will feature plenty of parks and gardens and other green spaces to allow people to enjoy nature and get fresh air. The city will also feature plenty of exercise options like gyms, swimming pools, and sports complexes. And as I mentioned early, Saudis will make sure to keep the air clean and healthy. The city will also have many hospitals and clinics to allow people to get checked on their health. Additionally, it will be the hotspot for innovation. Saudi Arabia will encourage many innovations and provide money to companies and tech startups to come to the city. Another key part of the city is that it will encourage building a community. The city will feature many events, public spaces, and other opportunities to build a strong community. The city will create many new job opportunities and help create jobs to keep up with population growth. It will provide many economic opportunities and bring people together, and it will take innovation to a new level to lead us to the future. 
</p>
    <p>Although Saudi's line city seems perfect, it does have a few downsides. The most obvious downside is with technology comes high costs, so the city will not be affordable to live in the line city unless you are decently wealthy. This will limit diversity. The city is also built for walking, limiting transportation, so it will be difficult to get out of the city, especially since it is in the middle of a desert. A big part of the city is innovation, so it will be costly for companies to keep up with advancements, and many will fall behind and lose loads of money. Building the city will be complex, and it might result in the death of many. And it will be hard for people to adjust to the change of lifestyle moving to such an advanced city never seen before. 
    </p>
    <p>The city is a genius idea, which will help advance us to the future, but it is not perfect. There are plenty of problems that need to be fixed before it is a good idea for other countries to follow suit. One of the key problems is the cost. It will be extremely expensive to build such a high-tech city, and it will be expensive to live. Although there are many challenges, Saudi's line city will give us a good idea of whether or not this is the future and help us make many more innovative discoveries. We will look back at it with great memories.
