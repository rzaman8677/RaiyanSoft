    <p>There are many health benefits to being vegetarian. Having a vegetarian diet typically means that you are consuming less saturated fats and cholesterol because veggies have significantly less saturated fats and cholesterol than meat, especially red meat and processed meat. Having high cholesterol and saturated fat can lead to heart problems and even heart diseases. Veggies contain plenty of fiber, vitamins, and minerals, so they can help you lower your cholesterol, which lowers your risk for heart problems. Veggies are rich in vitamin C, vitamin E, folate, which is known as vitamin B9, and potassium. These nutrients can have vital impacts on your health. They can help prevent chronic diseases and bad health and improve your mental health and well-being. Being vegetarian can also reduce your risk for type-2 diabetes because veggies have a high amount of fiber and nutrients, which can lower your blood sugar levels and even reduce your body’s insulin resistance. Another benefit of being vegetarian is that veggies are rich in antioxidants and phytochemicals, which act as an antioxidant. Antioxidants protect the body from these harmful molecules called free radicals. If enough of these free radicals build up, it can lead to cellular damage in your body. This can lead to the development of many chronic diseases, cancers, heart disease, and even Alzheimer’s disease. Some of you may love the taste of red meats, but is it worth it if you cannot remember it? Some other benefits include veggies being lower in calories, leading to less weight gain, and veggies being rich in fiber and good bacteria leading to gut health. You may wonder, if you are vegetarian, why are more people not making the switch? The simple reason is the taste, and who does not like a good steak? This article will explore food technology to make veggies taste like your favorite delicacies and the tech developments. We will also explore what has led to these projects failing and if making veggies taste like meat is the right way.
    </p>
    <p>One of the companies innovating to create veggies that taste like your favorite meat items are Beyond Meat and Impossible Burger. Impossible Burger is a private company, but Beyond Meat is, and it is struggling. In its earlier life, Beyond Meat was thriving by doubling the stock's IPO price, but the price now is less than half of the IPO price. The goal of these companies is to use veggies to create products that look, taste, and smell like meat. They also want to give one of the main benefits of meat, protein. That is why these companies use pea protein, soy protein, and potato protein. These ingredients have high protein content similar to meat, and they, in addition, can mimic the taste and texture. Once the ingredients are chosen, they go through a process of grinding, mixing, and heating to create a mixture similar to dough that needs cooking. This mixture, then, can be shaped into the desired product. A key element in making these fake meats is a molecule called heme. Heme is found in high concentration in many animals and gives an animal its flavor and smell. Beyond Meat and Impossible Burger use this same molecule, the plant-based version. They usually get heme from soy leghemoglobin. Then comes the cooking process, where the fake meat is cooked and flavored with plenty of seasonings and other flavoring methods to resemble their counterparts. A problem with this process is that these companies add crazy amounts of seasoning, salt, and other unhealthy stuff. This could lead to the supposed vegetables being as unhealthy or unhealthier than their meat counterparts. Besides that, fake meat technology has gotten unreal, and it is hard to distinguish the taste between them. Some companies even go all out by trying to recreate the bleeding in meats in fake meats. 
    </p>
    <p>To answer why fake meat is failing depends on a few factors. Some true meat lovers can still distinguish the taste difference, making them reluctant to switch. These meats are not affordable, so even if some people wanted to, the switch would not make sense because of the price. They are not that high in availability either. No one is going to spend their time hunting down the Impossible Burger or Beyond Meat. Additionally, many people have had bad experiences with these products when trying them in earlier stages or trying them from a worse brand. Also, many people are skeptical of the technology, as it seems too good, making people believe that many unhealthy chemicals or additives are added or why else it tastes so much like the real thing, which is true because they do add many ingredients that get rid of the positives of becoming vegetarians. Additionally, some argue that veggies are meant to be veggies and that it does not make sense for brands to try so hard to make veggies something they are not. These fake meat companies should reconsider their business model or do something because they are struggling.
