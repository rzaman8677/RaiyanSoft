    <h1 class="articleTitle">XPENG</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="xpeng.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>XPeng is an electric car(EV) company in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. The company was founded in 2014 by He Xiaopeng and Xia Heng. The company is very innovative, creating various vehicles. XPeng’s main market is in Europe and China, where its main competitors are Nio, Tesla, and Li Motors. The main things that attract people to Tesla are them being the pioneers of an era of electric cars, and the main selling point of NIO is their interesting technology relating to services and batteries, but XPeng brings something new. They are a highly innovative company with a bright future. This article will explore some of the cool technologies of XPeng. 
    </p>
    <p>To start, XPeng has plenty of cash with billions, so it can operate without the fear of bankruptcy for years to come. With this cash, they can also continue developing their advanced technologies. The company currently has four models available to customers and is actively working on many more. The models available to customers include the P7, P5, G3i, and G9. The P series is more of a sedan vehicle, while the G series is an SUV-type vehicle. Their vehicles have an amazing range for an electric car, with their G9 SUV having up to 702 kilometers of range which is about 436 miles of range, which is higher than Tesla’s highest ranged vehicle (XPeng). XPeng also has a futuristic design on the outside with the use of LEDs and the car having no grill. However, the interior of an XPeng is similar to that of a regular car, with multiple buttons and screens for different features. XPeng believes having the traditional interior will attract more customers by making the switch more comforting, knowing you are not changing everything about your car. If you are reluctant to switch to an EV, XPeng has got you covered. XPeng also has advanced autonomous driving, testing SAE level 4 autonomous driving. SAE, also known as the Society of Automotive Engineers Levels of Driving Automation, is a company that sets standards for autonomous driving, with six levels from 0, the lowest, to 5, the highest (“SAE”). Tesla only has SAE level 2 autonomous driving, so XPeng is quite ahead. XPeng uses various types of sensors to achieve this impressive accomplishment. They use LIDAR technology to create real-time, three-dimensional maps of the environment around them; they also use cameras for extra information and to back up what the LIDAR system sees; they use high-precision GPS to track the vehicle’s exact location and movements in real-time, and they use artificial intelligence algorithm to make decisions based on the sensors. The only reason you only hear about Tesla’s autonomous cars is that they advertise them as fully self-driving, which is misleading, and the fact that they are the largest car company in the world. Their fans also market the company for free, which XPeng lacks. But XPeng has other things to compensate for this. They have the fastest-charging SUV with 480-kilowatt-hour charging speeds, almost double the fastest-charging Tesla SUV ("15"). With range anxiety being one of the top fears of people thinking about switching to electric, having a higher range and charging speeds than Tesla will help. But they do not get rid of anxiety, as XPeng also has good speed. Their fastest car went from 0 to 60 miles in 3.9 seconds (XPeng). You will be too busy zooming around places instead of thinking about the range. Tesla does have faster cars, but for a larger SUV in the X9, it is impressive. They also have over-the-air updates, an AI assistant, a frunk, and an app to control the car like their competitors. XPeng went with a good idea of focusing more on their SUVs because many families are willing to spend good money on SUVs. But what if I told you this was not what makes XPeng unique? XPeng is unique because out of the EV companies I mentioned earlier, XPeng is the only company from the bunch working on a flying car. Not just a flying car, but an electric flying car. XPeng's flying car is called the Aero HT. It is also the first flying car in China to receive a flight permit (XPeng). The car has had thousands of successful test flights and even had a public one in Dubai (X2). Tesla, NIO, and Li Auto have cool tech, but do they have a flying car? No.
</p>
    <p>XPeng is an innovative company innovating towards the future. They might be quiet, but their products do the talking for them. They have advanced technology and a well-developed car. They are making the switch to EVs easier, and they will give Tesla a run for its money. If XPeng's flying car can take off, literally and metaphorically, we could start talking about a new king of EVs.
