    <img class="articleImage" src="hydrogenaircraft.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>The future of hydrogen-powered airplanes, commonly known as hydrogen fuel cell airplanes, appears to be brighter than that of electric airplanes. Hydrogen fuel cell airplanes create energy by combining hydrogen in tanks with oxygen in the atmosphere. This is also referred to as electrochemical conversion. This electricity drives the electric motors on the aircraft, which in turn power the jet's propellers or engines. It is environmentally friendly, clean, and efficient because water vapor is the sole byproduct. This technology is not yet viable in airplanes and has to be developed further. Certain autos employ the technology, but commercial airplanes do not. 
    </p>
    <p>In the current state, it would be better to create electric aircraft than hydrogen-power aircraft, but that is just because we have spent more time improving the electrical battery technology. The efficiency of electric batteries can range from eighty to ninety percent, while the efficiency of hydrogen cells can be less than half at forty to sixty percent, so that is also a reason we see a good amount of electric cars but not many hydrogen-powered cars. One of the key advantages of hydrogen-powered systems is that they will weigh way less than batteries, as batteries are large and heavy, and hydrogen fuel cells and storage tanks are not that heavy. Aircraft are not meant to be heavy for aerodynamics, so it would not be a good idea to use batteries to create such a heavy system. Another advantage of hydrogen-powered aircraft is that electric vehicles lose range due to heat since heat causes batteries to degrade, making the battery lose range. Heat can also cause vehicles to use more energy to cool down the vehicle. This is not a problem with hydrogen-powered systems, so you will have a more accurate idea of how much range you will have for your aircraft. You do not want to be unsure if you are going to be able to complete a flight because of the uncertainty of how the heat will affect your range. Additionally, hydrogen-powered systems have a higher energy density than batteries, so you need less space to store hydrogen, so if we can get the efficiency up of hydrogen-powered systems you can have hydrogen-powered aircraft with crazy amounts of range. The high energy density of hydrogen-powered systems can also allow quicker charging times, as hydrogen takes up less space. Additionally, hydrogen-powered aircraft would be able to charge way faster than an electric system since they do not need to charge, but they need to be pumped up with high-density hydrogen, like a regular gas pump, but with hydrogen. Charging batteries is already long enough for smaller cars, so imagine how long it will take for an aircraft. It would take crazy amounts of time. Even if some insanely fast charging technology came along, it would not be good for the battery’s long-term health. Speaking of long-term health, hydrogen-powered systems can last much longer than battery systems because hydrogen systems do not face degradation to the same degree as batteries, and hydrogen cells use a chemical process to generate electricity compared to batteries’ mechanical processes, which causes more damage. Aircraft can be expensive, so you do not want to be forced to spend more money on maintenance or replacing the entire battery system or even the plane. 
</p>
    <p>Although there are a lot of advantages to hydrogen-powered aircraft, there are still disadvantages. As I mentioned earlier, we need to figure out how to improve efficiency. We also have to figure out energy storage systems for hydrogen. Hydrogen also needs to be stored at high temperatures or low temperatures. A safety problem with hydrogen cells is that hydrogen can be very flammable, so we need to create a system to prevent the leak of hydrogen and make them puncture-proof. Additionally, hydrogen is currently more expensive than gas and electricity by a huge margin. Also, the process used to get hydrogen relies on fossil fuels, so it is not as clean as it sounds. Hydrogen-powered systems also do not have merely as much support as electric systems, so there is a lot to fix before we can adopt hydrogen-powered aircraft.
    </p>
    <p>Hydrogen-powered planes might be a viable alternative to electric planes. Hydrogen-powered aircraft have some benefits, including less weight, higher energy density, and improved system durability, but they also have considerable disadvantages. High hydrogen costs, a lack of infrastructure for hydrogen storage, and safety issues owing to hydrogen leaks are also factors. However, if we can enhance the efficiency of hydrogen-powered systems, discover safe and dependable ways to store hydrogen, and make it more readily available, hydrogen-powered aircraft may become the aviation industry's preferred source of transport in the future. We may continue to expand and prosper in the aviation industry, which is critical to international trade and transportation, by examining all choices and devising the optimal solution. It is critical to monitor hydrogen-powered aircraft. Potential breakthroughs should be assessed to see whether they bring us one step closer to depending on clean, efficient, and sustainable transportation.
