    <p>You may have heard about quantum computing, but what is it? Quantum computing is something that uses quantum mechanics to perform operations on data. It is vastly different from regular computing, which utilizes bits, commonly known as 0s and 1s, or off and on. Quantum computing uses quantum bits, also known as qubits. In regular computing, bits can have one state, either 0 or 1, but in quantum computing, qubits can have multiple states. This phenomenon is called superposition. A qubit can be represented by a two-state quantum system. They can be manipulated by the use of quantum operations like rotations, phase shifts, and interactions with other qubits. The relationship between two qubits is called entanglement, where their correlation affects the state of the other one, no matter how far apart they are. You may wonder how the state of a qubit is measured. The state of a qubit is measured by a process known as quantum measurement, where the superposition of a qubit collapses in one of its two states. You may wonder, what is special about this? Since qubits can exist in multiple states, you can do many calculations simultaneously. And since you can relate qubits, no matter how far they are, you can do calculations faster with quantum computers. This technology can be useful in cryptography, where you need big math problems solved. But if quantum computing is so good, you may wonder why you do not have a quantum computer. The simple answer is that the technology is still in its early stages and has many errors and problems. 
    </p>
    <p>One of the main problems with qubits is their stability. Qubits require very exact specifications to prevent decoherence, the loss of quantum coherence, which is the idea of superposition. Decoherence occurs due to quantum computers requiring specific requirements. You need a balance of temperature, pressure, and magnetic fields to ensure the integrity of qubits. If conditions are unstable, the computer will have fluctuations and not be as accurate as before. Another challenge is scalability. Qubits need to be separated from the environment, so they do not lose their quantum properties. You need to reduce exposure to external magnetic fields, lower temperatures, and other disturbances, which are complex for more qubits. Another issue is that quantum systems are susceptible to noise, so it will be hard to detect with a large number of qubits. Additionally, at its current state, it is insanely expensive to build high amounts of qubits, and it will take plenty of research. You would also have to reteach software development because quantum computers function differently. You have to modify programming languages to work with qubits instead of bits. We also have to figure out how to integrate regular computing with quantum computing because it will not be global for a long time, as it is in the earlier stages. There are many problems with integrating qubits, but we can fix these problems.
    </p>
    <p>Scientists are experimenting with many ways to stop the decohering of bits. One of the methods suggested is cryogenic cooling, which works with cryocoolers. Cryocoolers are refrigerator systems that use helium to remove heat to cool the environment to the desired temperature ideal for qubits, which is as close as possible to zero. Another method being used is shielding the qubits from their environment. The first part is physical shielding, which could be done by utilizing layers of superconducting materials. Superconducting materials are materials that can absorb and reflect electromagnetic fields and radiation. Additionally, you can use layers of insulating materials, which can reduce the temperature fluctuation of qubits, allowing stability. But there is also software shielding, where external factors can be corrected by continuously monitoring the state of qubits and acting in response. Another thing we have to decide is whether to use superconducting qubits or topological qubits. Superconducting qubits work with superconducting materials, which utilize materials cooled to extremely low temperatures, which reduces electrical resistance, allowing stability for qubits. Topological qubits use materials with electronic properties that are strong against disturbances. We can fix these issues and get to a quantum computing era.
    </p>
    <p>Quantum computing is a very promising technology with unlimited potential. It has the potential to change how computing works and allow us to solve more complex problems faster and solve multiple problems concurrently. Quantum computing can create many new jobs and opportunities and solve many new problems. There are still some problems in the way, such as decoherence, integrating the technology with classical computing, creating software for quantum computing, and cost, to name a few, but we can overcome this problem with methods such as shielding, cryogenic cooling, and other solutions being developed. It will be well worth it if we develop this technology. As time goes on, we will look back and see why quantum computing was so touted.
