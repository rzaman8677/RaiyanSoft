    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Barry Chen</b><br>A big fan of mobile gaming and food.</p>
    <p>Technology has made significant strides in recent years to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. From assistive devices and software to modifications in physical spaces and online environments, advances in technology have opened up new opportunities and improved the quality of life for individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p>One example of technology being used to improve accessibility is through the use of assistive devices. These devices can range from simple tools like magnifiers and handheld scanners to more complex systems like motorized wheelchairs and prosthetics. Assistive devices are designed to help individuals with disabilities perform tasks that may be difficult or impossible for them to do without assistance. For example, individuals with visual impairments may use a screen reader software to access the internet or read documents, while individuals with mobility impairments may use a motorized wheelchair to move around their home or community (<i>National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research, "Assistive Technology"</i>).</p>
<p>In addition to assistive devices, technology has also been used to make physical spaces more accessible for individuals with disabilities. This includes modifications to buildings and other structures to make them more easily accessible for individuals with mobility impairments, as well as the incorporation of features like audio descriptions and closed captioning in public spaces like movie theaters and museums (<i>Disability Rights and Resources Center, "Accessibility in Public Spaces"</i>).</p>
<p>Online environments have also been made more accessible through the use of technology. This includes the use of website design best practices and tools like screen readers and magnifiers to make websites and other digital content more accessible for individuals with visual impairments. It also includes the use of captions and transcripts for videos and audio content, as well as the use of alt text and other accessibility features to make images and other visual elements more accessible for individuals with visual impairments (<i>WebAIM, "Accessibility in Online Environments"</i>).</p>
<p>An important aspect of using technology to improve accessibility for individuals with disabilities is the need for universal design. Universal design refers to the design of products and environments that are accessible to the widest range of individuals, including those with disabilities. This includes designing products and environments with the needs of individuals with disabilities in mind, as well as ensuring that they are easy to use and accessible for individuals with a variety of abilities (<i>Center for Universal Design, "Universal Design"</i>).</p>
<p>Technology has played a significant role in improving accessibility for individuals with disabilities. From assistive devices and software to modifications in physical spaces and online environments, advances in technology have opened up new opportunities and improved the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. It is important to continue to develop and utilize technology to ensure that individuals with disabilities have equal access to the same opportunities and experiences as those without disabilities.</p>
