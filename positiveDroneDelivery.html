    <img class="articleImage" src="drone.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>We are in a new era, the era of speed. Time is a valuable thing, and people are not willing to lose or waste any time. That is also a large reason for the success of Amazon and their Amazon prime and other companies creating a similar model, like Walmart. People want their deliveries at faster rates than before and are willing to pay crazy amounts of money. That is why companies are starting to use or are planning to use drones for even faster deliveries. If done correctly, drones can be the future of delivery, and we might be close to a new era of deliveries. Drones could change our everyday lives for good and make life easier. In this article, we will explore drone technology for making deliveries and the benefits of using drone technology for making deliveries.
    </p>
    <p>First, let us explore how a drone delivery system might work. The first step is, of course, the customer placing the order. The order would then be processed and prepared by a worker. The worker would load up the drone, and the drone is programmed to a certain delivery location, and it would use GPS technology and object detection to get to its destination. The drone would then deliver the package right into the hands of the customer or onto an area chosen by the customer. It sounds easy, but let us explore it more. 
    </p>
    <p>The obvious benefit is cost savings for companies. With drones, you do not need to pay a delivery driver, and drones do not use fuel. Companies will have to charge drones, and electricity is about four times cheaper than gas, so it will save companies a good chunk of money. But if companies save money, it could also mean that customers save money, as delivery prices will be cheaper. Another advantage for the customer is speed. Since drones can fly, they will not be subject to traffic, and they can also dodge obstacles with object detection, so they will be able to get you your package in short periods. This can especially be useful in cities, as it can take hours to go a mile and the fact that there are so many people, meaning so many more orders. Additionally, drones can reach crazy high speeds, even over 200 mph, so you will be able to get your package even faster. Another obvious advantage is helping the environment. Drones need to be charged, so they use renewable energy and not fossil fuels, which will immensely help the environment, especially since there are a crazy amount of deliveries every day. Drones can also help people with disabilities, as they can drop packages directly into your hands, so if your mailbox is far away, you no longer need to walk such long distances. Drones can also deliver packages to places hard to reach by ground traveling methods and places that may be dangerous, potentially saving many lives. Additionally, drones can deliver packages when there is plenty of snow or ice on the ground, as they can fly. But that is not all, drones can reduce human contact, which is important during pandemics, as we have all seen after Covid-19. It can also be useful for privacy reasons, so if you do not want people to see your property, you do not need them to. This will be handy for people with kids especially, as parents will not need to worry about their kid getting kidnapped or talking to a stranger. Drones can also operate 24/7, so you do not have to constantly check the delivery status just to realize that the delivery company does not deliver packages overnight or later in the day. It can also be useful if you need a late-night snack or you forgot something at the store. But drones will not just benefit companies and people receiving packages. Drones can benefit everyone. Drones will mean fewer delivery vehicles on the road, so you will see less traffic congestion. No one likes traffic, so this is perfect for people who want to reach their destination. But another huge benefit is for tech lovers, as they will be able to sit on their porch and watch their package being delivered by a drone, which can be more fun than whatever is in the package. 
    </p>
    <p>Drones are a very innovative solution to increase delivery speeds. They can make people's lives much easier and have plenty of other benefits not mentioned here. Drones will make everyone's lives easier for the good, whether you are the one ordering the package or not. The environment, especially, will thrive from this innovation. If companies can continue improving drone technology, we can start to see more drones being used for deliveries. It is not a long time before we start seeing drones daily.
