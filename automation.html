    <h1 class="articleTitle">AI and Automation impact on Jobs</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="automation.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>Artificial intelligence(AI) and the automation of repetitive tasks have been becoming more prevalent in modern-day companies. Companies, such as Tesla and Lucid Motors, are using more and more automation and AI as technology has been seeing rapid improvements. As a result, a lot of people are getting displaced from their jobs, so I am going to analyze the outlook of AI and automation on the modern-day job market, the benefits and drawbacks, and possible ways to mitigate the issues. I will also analyze which jobs seem to be the most vulnerable to disruptions and change and how students and anyone, in general, can prepare for these dynamic shifts coming into the job market. </p>
    <p>To begin, let us talk about the negatives of automation for companies and the job industry. First, the loss of jobs is immediate, as machines are not here to supplement people in their jobs but to take human jobs, but it creates some jobs for maintenance of these machines, but these jobs will require a lot of skill. People from disadvantaged communities will suffer because they will not be able to work in these technical fields with a lot of competition, whether it is a lack of education or a lack of resources. It will create an uphill battle for many, and the socioeconomic gap will widen. In addition, creativity will be lost without humans. Humans are more creative than machines, so losing their creativity is definitely going to be a loss. Machines will continue to become more efficient, but they will not be able to bring the innovation needed to make the breakthrough discoveries that we as a society might need. Companies will also need to focus a lot on cybersecurity because we are in a generation with many vulnerabilities online, and many are learning how to hack. One hack could be enough to take a company down for good, so companies might be unsure of going full out. Also, there are a lot of ethical issues with the data collected or being used, which could lead to legal issues. Companies could be using unethical data points even without their knowledge which could ruin a company's reputation and take them to court. Another issue is that it will be hard to assess how the AI model is making decisions based on the data points, so companies will have less input on how to implement the tasks asked to be performed by machines. And again, technology can fail at any time, so that can be scary. It will also be expensive at first to implement at the moment. Many things need to be fixed before we can rely on automation in industries.</p>
    <p>The losses of jobs from automating repetitive tasks and using more AI can appear terrifying, but it does have some notable benefits. To start, it saves companies a lot of money than manual labor. This could help make more companies successful and in profit, as employees are one of a company's largest expenses, which should help smaller companies compete with the big players. Also, in a data-driven era, it will allow companies to collect more data from the machine's reports, which can show companies how to make processes faster, and the machine itself can learn how to speed processes. The data will also be significantly more accurate than having a human record data, and it could record way more data than a human could. In addition, a machine could predict when your company should order more parts and when it needs maintenance. But that is not all, as companies would get increased security and not need to worry about employees giving away confidential information to competitors. Automation could also save lives or prevent injuries by applying these technologies to more dangerous tasks, hopefully reducing child labor and incentivizing companies with a more efficient solution. It will also save a lot of time because, if it was not obvious enough, people are slower than machines. A machine can finish the same tasks as a human in ridiculously low amounts of time. Plus, machines do not need to sleep, so they can work 24/7, while humans cannot. It prevents the need for people to work extremely long hours. It can also reduce errors because, say, you have a human entering data or doing some other repetitive task, and they are, of course, human, so they could easily make an accident and enter the wrong numbers or make one incorrect movement, while a machine cannot unless there is a bug with the code. This could also allow more people to work in more creative fields where AI and automation cannot be as effective as a human, so people can do stuff they would probably enjoy more. As I mentioned earlier, these jobs being replaced are repetitive tasks, so they are generally decently unamusing, so it could help mental health by closing these overly repetitive jobs. So implementing more automation is not as bad as it sounds. </p>
    <p>In conclusion, artificial intelligence(AI) and automation can help and hurt society. It also causes job loss and widens the socioeconomic gap, and on the other hand, it saves companies money, increases efficiency, and reduces errors. While it is vital to be mindful of the challenges posed by automation, it is also key to recognize the benefits and find ways to mitigate the negative impacts, such as through upskilling and reskilling programs. As technology advances, people and society as a whole must prepare for the vigorous shifts in the job market and embrace the prospects presented by AI and automation.    </p>
