    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>The Golden State Warriors are currently in the midst of one of the greatest dynasties of all time, led by the magical Stephen Curry. The warriors' main core three have stayed intact for the duration of their dynasty in a league where players constantly team-hop. A big part of their success is due to this loyalty. But the core three cannot do it alone, as their general manager, Bob Myers, has constantly added star players, whether it is through free agency, trades, the g-league, or the draft. Kevin Durant, Jordan Poole, Andrew Wiggins, and Gary Payton II are some notable players that the Warriors have gotten in recent years. All of this is brought together by Steve Kerr, the Warriors coach. Kerr is a former player, so he has the experience and knows what the players constantly go through. Although the warriors are defending champions, they are constantly struggling to even get to the 500 mark. Even though they are struggling to get to that mark, I believe they can still win the championship.</p>
    <p>First of all, we need to examine what has led to the warriors' struggles. To start, they lost Gary Payton II, Otto Porter Jr, and Nemanja Bjlecia. These players were incredible and were instrumental in the warriors' win in the finals, so losing them, especially Gary Payton II(until he got traded back), really hurt them, as they could not afford to retain them. The Warriors are, of course, deep into the luxury tax, even though most of their roster was drafted, which poses the question of why teams should be punished for drafting their own stars, but that is for another time. But keeping in track, the Warriors could not spend that much in free agency and could only sign players on minimums, and the tax-payer mid level exception. They were able to sign Donte Divincenzo, using some of the tax-payer mid level exceptions, and JaMychal Green on the veterans minimum. The Warriors also signed Anthony Lamb and Ty Jerome to two-way contracts and cut the promising Quindarary Weatherspoon. The Warriors also drafted two promising rookies, Patrick Baldwin Jr and Ryan Rollins, so outside of the Warriors' starting lineup, the team is pretty inexperienced and young. In addition to having a lot of inexperienced players, their star players, specifically Klay Thompson and Jordan Poole, were struggling immensely with horrible shooting splits. In addition to that, Moody and Kuminga were not given consistent minutes to Kuminga and Moody, as he did not trust them, and he gave minutes to Anthony Lamb and Ty Jerome instead. The Warriors were struggling, but luckily Wiggins and Steph were able to stop them from completely sinking. The Warriors would slowly get back into a groove when Curry got injured, and they started winning games with Kuminga being a more integral part. Patrick Baldwin Jr even started seeing minutes, and he showed off his pretty shot. Everything was clicking throughout the roster, except for Moody. Moody has lost almost all the trust Steve Kerr had in him. He has had a couple of decent games, but Kerr has consistently preferred Anthony Lamb over him. I believe Kerr should play Moody more because as we have seen last year and in the playoffs, he was able to hold his own, and Moody has all the tools needed to contribute. Steve Kerr needs to be more willing to give Moody minutes. He did not even give him minutes on the final defensive possession of one of their games, and he chose Ty Jerome instead, who is a great player, but Moody is a better defender, without a doubt. The Warriors would slowly lose their groove, and Curry coming back did not propel them to the level they needed, and neither did Wiggins. The Warriors have shown a failure to close out close games and win on the road. The only positive thing has been Jonathan Kuminga's amazing play. Now let us examine how the Warriors can get back to champion form. 
    </p>
    <p>The Warriors need to figure out their roster, as their two-way players can only play 50 games and none in the playoffs, so they need to decide whether to give them roster spots. I believe the Warriors should convert Ty Jerome's contract to a minimum as the Warriors need more playmakers on the bench, especially since they struggle late game. Anthony Lamb has been good, but he can be selfish at times and constantly takes questionable shots. He also gets sloppier as the game goes on, and his defense is not the best. Ty Jerome, on the other hand, is a pretty solid defender for his position, even without the athletic tools, as he puts in a lot of effort. He is also an amazing playmaker. I especially think this move is needed because the Warriors should stick with Jordan Poole in the starting lineup over Looney, as he plays tremendously better with better players around him. This means Poole will need some rest, so he cannot singlehandedly lead to the bench, as he can get sloppy at times when tired and late in games. I also think the Warriors could consider converting Ryan Rollins' contract to a two-way and sign a big, as the team lacks size. The Warriors did not address this problem during the trade-deadline, but they got back Gary Payton II, which is more valuable. Gary Payton II’s energy and enthusiasm should help the Warriors out. The Warriors also should play Moody some more consistent minutes, as he has good size, which the Warriors need more. In addition, Donte DiVincenzo needs to keep getting good minutes, as his shooting, rebounding, and defense are critical to the Warriors. Kuminga should also continue to get a lot of minutes. The Warriors might want to consider putting Kuminga in the starting lineup over Wiggins, as crazy as it sounds. Kuminga is an amazing player, and he could add some more size to the three-guard lineup. Additionally, Wiggins does not get a lot of scoring opportunities with the three-guard lineup, so he would benefit from more shots on the bench. He would also benefit from the playmaking of Donte and Ty and occasionally Poole. Kuminga has also shown to play even better with the starters. But Kuminga is not the only young player who should be getting more recognition. Patrick Baldwin Jr has one of the best shots in the NBA and has all the tools on defense. He also has the size the Warriors lack, so the Warriors should look at him if they do not want to look for size through free agency. He is young but poised under pressure, coming from a family where his dad is a coach. If the Warriors can follow these steps, they should be on the road to winning Curry his 5th Championship and 2nd Finals MVP.
