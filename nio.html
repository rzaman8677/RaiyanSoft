    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>NIO is a Chinese electric vehicle(EV) company founded in 2014 by William Li, Lihong Qi, and Hsien Tong Cheng. Nio stands for Next-Generation Ion, and their logo represents a dragon in the sky, showing their desire for innovation and progress. Their slogan is "Born for Enjoyment, Built for Life(Nio)." Nio is an innovative company aiming to create innovative solutions and become an industry leader in the future. Nio is one of the most, if not the most, interesting electric car companies in the world. The cars in their lineup include the ET7, ET5, ES8, ES7, ES6, EC7, EC6, and the EP9 supercar (Nio). They have won various awards such as the 2021 World Car Design of the Year for the NIO EC6, 2021 iF Design Award for the NIO EC6, 2021 Red Dot Design Award for the NIO EC6, 2020 CES Best of Innovation Award for NIO Pilot, 2019 Red Dot Design Award for the NIO ES6, 2019 iF Design Award for the NIO ES6, 2018 World Car Design of the Year for the NIO EP9, 2018 Golden Steering Wheel Award for the NIO ES8, 2017-2018 Car of the Year China for the NIO ES8, and the 2017-2018 Best Car Award for the NIO ES8. A large part of this success is due to innovation, technology, and partnerships that NIO has. Some of NIO's notable partnerships include Tencent and NVIDIA for autonomous driving and CATL for battery technology (NIO). The company also has billions of dollars in cash to help advance its technology, thanks to Sequoia Capital and Hillhouse Capital (NIO). One of the reasons that NIO needs money is because of their bet on the future of electric car charging. Instead of charging car batteries, NIO believes in battery swapping, where you swap out your battery for a fully charged one instead of charging the EV. NIO is going all out on this technology, and if it goes right, NIO might be able to reach the top of the industry by licensing this technology. NIO has created an automated charging robot that works 24/7 to swap out depleted batteries for fully charged ones. It can perform a swap in around 3 minutes and swap out multiple batteries simultaneously. The only disappointing part of the charging robot is that it cannot charge the depleted battery, and the battery has to be sent to a separate facility to be charged, so the name is deceptive. NIO also has Power Mobile Charging Trucks, trucks providing services to charge car batteries, so NIO has not fully converted to battery swapping. NIO has charging stations too. Additionally, NIO is working on wireless charging stations, which might be more intriguing, as imagine if technology is advanced enough to allow you to charge your car while driving. This would eliminate range concerns, and it would make up for NIO's subpar range of the low 200s for most of their vehicles, but they claim 621 miles of range with their ET7. This would be the longest range for an EV, but it is not EPA certified. Another service NIO offers is in-car delivery services which allow you to have your packages delivered to your car. Having your package delivered directly to your car is pretty useful, so you can feel confident that no one will steal your package. But some potential issues are larger packages, not having enough space in your vehicle, and the concern of the delivery driver stealing valuables in your EV. Now going back to the actual vehicle, NIO currently has level 3 autonomy, but they are testing level 4. They also have their own AI assistant called NOMI, so you can do stuff like turning on the music, turning on the AC, and other simple tasks. The car also features over-the-air software updates, so the car continues to improve after purchase, and their EVs come with all the safety features, such as lane departure and cruise control. The car also has ambient lighting, energy recuperation, which regenerates some energy when braking, dynamic suspension, keyless entry, advanced navigation with real-time traffic, and a sleek panoramic roof. NIO also has an app to check on key data points when battery swapping, how your battery is doing, unlocking your car, changing the car temperature, and much more. A key part of the car is data. Whenever you change or charge your battery, it shows you data about the battery's health, vehicle performance, and more through NIO's connected cloud platform. They also have support stations to have maintenance checks on your car and fix any issues. Their technology justifies all of these rewards that they have been awarded, and they are trying to take over parts of Europe and China with this technology. China is one of the most populated countries in the world, so NIO has a big market. They also have an advantage over Tesla, as a Chinese company. Overall, NIO has a bright future and a chance to overtake Tesla if some of its big technology bets work.</p>
