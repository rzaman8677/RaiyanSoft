    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>What is one of the most important things in life? The answer to this question is time. You cannot do anything if you do not have time. That is why it is really important to create faster methods of transportation. Companies around the world are in a tech battle to create commercial transportation methods available to the public to save people loads of time. One of the most fascinating technologies being built was the hyperloop by none other than Elon Musk. But Elon has since stopped the project, citing the insanely high costs to mass implement the hyperloop. So you may wonder what rocket fast transportation methods are being developed now and why companies struggle to develop and get out such fast technologies. That is what this article is going to discuss. We are going to discuss the most promising land, and air transportation methods.
    </p>
    <p>One of the most intriguing transportation methods is Shanghai China's Maglev, also known as a magnetic levitation train, train. The maglev train was first used in 2004 in Shanghai, China, but since then, there have been various new locations (“How”). This train is no regular train, as it uses technology more advanced and innovative than that. The train works by magnetic levitation, the process of suspending an object in the air using magnetic fields. This works for this train by using insanely strong electromagnets,  creating a strong magnetic field capable of suspending this train in the air. Traditional trains make contact with the track, but this method involves no contact with the track, which removes friction and prevents wear and tear from rubbing off on the track. Without this added friction, the maglev train can reach insane speeds that are not in typical trains. This allows China’s maglev train in Shanghai to reach insane speeds of 370 miles per hour, equivalent to 600 kilometers per hour, the fastest speed for public transportation on land (“How”). These trains also provide a safer and better experience for passengers. Since maglev trains do not rely on tracks, it does not get impacted by bad weather, making the tracks slippery or something similar or track failure. Additionally, the maglev train has a lower chance of mechanical failure because it makes no contact with the track. China’s support for this project enabled this project to succeed and not fail like the hyperloop. 
    </p>
    <p>The fastest form of air transportation available to the public was supersonic jets. Supersonic jets were like regular jets but built for speed. They had very aerodynamic designs and powerful engines. These types of systems were built for speed. These supersonic jets were available to the public but not since. The last commercial supersonic jet was the Concorde and happened to be the last (“Why”). There are multiple reasons I believe the plane failed. A supersonic jet is extremely expensive to create and maintain, as they use advanced technology and are not that efficient. At such speeds, there is plenty of danger, so the insurance costs should have been astronomical. The plane was not environmentally friendly and caused a lot of air pollution. And since the jet could reach over a thousand miles of speed, and when at a high enough altitude, the aircraft would generate a sonic boom when it broke the sound barrier, which most likely was disturbing to people living near the airport. There are many problems to be fixed before we see the next commercial supersonic jet, if ever, but companies are still working on making them.
    </p>
    <p>There are plenty of sea vehicles, but they are not fast. They can be considered fast relative to the average sea vehicle, but even a car can go faster. Sea commercial transportation is not the future of high-speed transportation. The fastest commercial sea vehicle cannot even reach a hundred miles, so it is better to develop fast air and ground transportation methods. 
    </p>
    <p>One of the problems with high-speed transportation methods is cost. These projects can cause billions and billions of dollars, which is not something any company can afford. The cost may be way above many companies' value. To create such advantageous high-speed commercial transportation methods, we need government support because otherwise, companies will not be able to afford to create them. We need something like how America created a lot of railroads in the nineteenth century. We need something like that to happen again if we want to see high-speed commercial transportation mass adoption because it is not feasible to create the necessary infrastructure without government support. Additionally, these devices take a lot of time to create because of the advanced technology needed. Another problem is the impact on the environment. To create the next commercial supersonic jet, we need to start finding ways to use renewable energy in these jets, and we need to find a way to minimize the sound of the sonic boom. It will take a lot of research, but it will be well worth it for the time saved. Imagine all the things you could do if you could ride a supersonic jet that can go insane speeds.
