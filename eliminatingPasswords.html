    <h1 class="articleTitle">Elimination of Passwords</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="biometrics.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>For years our main source of security has been the use of passwords. It makes sense why we used passwords, but we are slowly switching away from them. There are many reasons why we are making this change and why it is necessary. Some of the alternatives include multi-factor authentication and biometric authentication, so this article will explore why we are switching away from passwords and what the alternatives are.
    </p>
    <p>One of the reasons passwords are going away is security. The point of passwords is for security, but if they are not secure, then what is the point? Many people choose simple passwords that even a first-grader can guess. If you do not believe me ask my mom, as I cracked her phone's screen time password as a kid. Additionally, it does not help that people use the same passwords throughout all their other accounts, even including me, but I have been switching recently. But it is not just people's fault for these insecurities. Hackers are constantly getting smarter and smarter, and it is becoming increasingly easy. There has been an increase in data breaches, phishing attacks, keyloggers, and the use of password-cracking software. So even if you have the world's most unguessable password, you are not safe and not even close. Additionally, the password experience is horrible, no one can remember all their passwords, and no one wants to keep track of all their passwords. Even if you did keep track of your passwords, it makes it easier for people to steal your passwords, as it is all in one place. Passwords ruin the experience of using certain applications. It also makes it harder to log in when websites have different password requirements, as one website might require special characters while another might not. Additionally, people lose accounts all time, so they will be forced to create new accounts, so companies will have to store more data, which costs money. Passwords need to be replaced. 
    </p>
    <p>One of the most promising alternatives is biometric authentication, which uses behavioral or physical characters, such as your fingerprint and face. Biometric scanning increases reliability. You cannot forget your biometric data or have it stolen. You cannot just lose your face or have it stolen that easily. Notice how I said easily, as technology has advanced so much that you could create a model to look exactly like someone, like deepfakes. But biometric authentication is more secure than passwords. But a problem is that biometric scanning cannot always recognize you or might incorrectly recognize someone else as you, so it is not entirely secure. But it does make it significantly complicated to hack or steal. 
    </p>
    <p>Another solution that might be better is multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA uses the best of all worlds, as it requires you to use multiple ways to log in. For example, you could choose to have a password and a biometric scan. Of course, it is still hackable, but it will be significantly harder with the multiple layers of security. 
    </p>
    <p>A more hardware-oriented approach could be a smart card. Smart cards contain a microprocessor, so they can be read by a device. This is one of the ways you can get into your Tesla, and it is pretty secure but has flaws. You could create a smart card that appears to be identical to the actual one, but it will be difficult. You could also hack the software used to read the card or steal the card. Additionally, not many people would like to use smart cards because they can lose them. I would say smart cards are not the best option, but they could be effective in conjunction with other authentication.
    </p>
    <p>Another similar approach is to use physical security keys. These keys follow a standard such as USB, NFC, or Bluetooth to communicate with a computer or mobile device, but it has similar problems to a smart card but is more secure than a password.
    </p>
    <p>One of the best alternatives is passwordless authentication. This form of authentication uses your phone as a key. It is more secure than a password, and it is something that you will not forget. This approach is the best for many people because people guard their phones with their life, and you need your phone for your daily life, so it is hard to forget. But once again, anything that involves physical devices involves some potential security problems, so if you do not want to get your information or car stolen, you should still consider using multi-factor authentication.
    </p>
    <p>Passwords are decreasing in use as hackers get smarter. The purpose of a password is for security, but they are not that secure, and they are more inconvenient than secure. We are slowly switching away from passwords to other means. Some of the alternatives include passwordless authentication, biometric authentication, physical keys, and a combination. Most of these alternatives are significantly more secure and convenient than passwords, but they are not completely secure, so we need to continue exploring ways to ensure security, but we should switch to these other ways now instead of using passwords.
