    <h1 class="articleTitle">EV Charging</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="evcharging.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>Many people have switched to electric cars or, at least, have been following the electric car news. There has been plenty of progress made by companies like Tesla, legacy makers such as Ford, and newcomers like Lucid Motors. Additionally, plenty of countries are attempting to phase out gas cars, so electric cars are the answer that many are resorting to, justifiably so, as Tesla has been seeing plenty of success, but we are constantly ignoring critical attention, an issue that needs attention. Electric cars do not have an unlimited range. They need charging, so why are so few people talking about charging companies, as there are problems? The problem people specify is the range of electric cars, but how can range be the problem if we have ultra-fast chargers? Also, why go to the gas station every day when you can charge from home? This article will investigate Tesla and Electrify America, a charging company founded by Volkswagen, charging networks and technology, but it will primarily discuss charging.
    </p>
    <p>First, we are going to talk about why I chose these companies. I chose Tesla since they are regarded as the pioneer and leader in electric cars, evident by their stock and market shares in the electric vehicle(EV) market, and I chose Electrify America because they are roughly a good company showing the performance of the other companies in addition to itself. These are two of the biggest charging networks. 
    </p>
    <p>First off, let us start with the positives of these companies. Both Tesla and Electrify America have impressively fast chargers. Tesla has a 250 kilowatt hour(kW) hour charger and Electrify America has a 350 kilowatt hour(kW) charger. A Tesla can charge from zero to eighty percent in around 30 minutes, while it takes 20 for an Electrify America charger. The reason I mention the time it takes to charge from zero to eighty percent is that that stretch is the fastest charge, and it is not a good idea to charge your EV to over eighty percent. If you constantly charge above eighty or do not charge your car around that, the car's battery will degrade faster. Now going back to the positives, electric cars are significantly cheaper to charge than traditional gas vehicles. The average gas car costs around 60 dollars to fill up, and the average electric car costs 15 dollars to charge using an Electrify America or Tesla charger. They also have plenty of chargers, with Tesla having about 40 thousand and Electrify America having nearly 4 thousand. You are helping the environment and saving money with an EV, but the charging networks have more problems than most people acknowledge. 
    </p>
    <p>One of the main problems with EVs is the charge time, as it takes around 30 minutes to charge your vehicle. Although that is incredibly fast, it is slow compared to a gas vehicle. You might save way more money with an EV, but as many say, time is money. If you are traveling large distances, you do not want to wait longer to get to your destination just because you have to charge your car. Another issue is that not every EV uses the same charger. Teslas use a different port than the vast majority of other companies, so you will need to get a converter to charge your car. Not everyone is tech savvy, so it is an extra step making it difficult for people to charge their vehicles, and it surely will make people less likely to go green. But Tesla is not the major problem, as it is companies like Electrify America. Electrify America chargers are not reliable. There are tons of their chargers out there, but plenty of them do not even work. You might have to go further distances to find a charger, but you will have to go even further to find a working charger. Tesla does not have charging problems, but they have an extremely reliable network of chargers. Another problem is that it costs more to charge an EV during peak hours since the demand is high for electricity, so you might be charging the same price as a gas car if you charge your EV at the wrong time. This forces many to charge their vehicles at night, and many people have a fear of charging their devices at night. 
    </p>
    <p>Electric vehicles are, without a doubt, the future or, at the very least, part of the future, but we need to worry more about the charging technology than the vehicles. Companies like Tesla have proven that technology is good, but the charging companies have done the opposite. It is too complex for the average consumer, and it has too many variables to it, and most of the charging companies apart from Tesla are unreliable. To make EVs worldwide, we need to fix the charging networks and increase the speed.
