    <h1 class="articleTitle">CAD Modeling & 3D Printing</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="cad.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>3D modeling, also known as computer-aided design(CAD) modeling, and 3D printing has seen a tick-up in usage. The use of these technologies has expanded exponentially, and the number of individuals acquiring the skills to use CAD and 3D modeling, whether for skilled purposes in fields such as engineering and construction or for hobby purposes, is continuing to increase astronomically. The growth of 3d printing has paved the path for new, innovative applications, from rapid prototyping and product development to custom manufacturing and unique artistic expressions. The use of 3D printing in industries such as healthcare and architecture has also gained momentum, leading to the invention of new products and solutions; as 3D modeling and 3D printing continue to develop, they will remain important tools for businesses and individuals, driving creativity and innovation and shaping the future.
    </p>
    <p>The first step is to find software for CAD, also known as computer-aided design. Some popular  CAD software includes Onshape, Fusion 360, and Solidworks. Much of this software is costly, so if you want to start for free, you should explore Onshape, and if you are in college, many engineering programs give you access to this software for free. If you are in high school, you could take a project lead the way(PLTW) engineering program to get free access to Fusion 360. There are a lot of tutorials, videos, courses, and classes on CAD. It also requires no external knowledge and could be picked up by any age group. The limit is the sky for CAD, and you can model almost anything and test them out with some simulators and tests, such as the load simulator and the weakness point test. After that, you can buy a 3D printer to print some of your creations. Some of the best printers available on the market for cheap are ones made by Creality and Prussia. I recommend Creality's Ender series because they are relatively cheap and easy to set up and use. I have the Ender 3 Pro, and it can do the job and print most things out without a problem. It is also relatively cheap, costing only two-hundred dollars, but I got mine on sale for one hundred dollars from a Microcenter. You can also get a spool of filament for pretty cheap, around twenty dollars. There are many materials you can choose to print from depending on what material properties you need. The Ender 3 Pro can handle most materials with ease. It is pretty easy to get into 3D modeling and 3D printing. All you need is dedication.
    </p>
    <p>3D printers are very useful in the engineering field. It allows you to prototype creations and test them on a miniature scale, and get an idea of how they would work. You can also play around with many materials to get more accurate representations. Additionally, you could use 3D-printed parts on your robot if you are interested in creating such things. For example, at the youth robotics competition FTC Robotics, you will see a lot of teams with robots using 3D-printed parts, and these parts are being used on a larger scale. Companies are using 3D printers to print concrete houses. It makes the process of creating a house cheaper, as there is no labor, barely any wasted materials, and faster building times, as machines are faster than humans, so as an engineer, it is a good idea to learn this skill. Additionally, a lot of colleges are requiring you to learn CAD for their engineering programs, so you might as well get a head start. </p>
    <p>Another field that 3D printing and modeling is art. Artists can easily reproduce their works of art by CAD modeling them and 3D printing them. Also, in an era where art is going digital, you can use rendering tools on many CAD software to make beautiful pieces of art. It is also cheap to start, so it will allow more people to become an artist and showcase their creations. The possibilities are unlimited for artists using CAD.
    </p>
    <p>In some other fields, CAD can be used in the film industry to create art and landscaping businesses to create beautiful structures. It can also be used in interior design to map a room and show your clients. Fashion designers could also utilize it to create unique clothes. Even game developers and animators could use it with the many features of CAD.</p>
    <p>To conclude, Computer-aided design(CAD) is a very important up-and-coming technology. It is a technology that is capable of making the lives of so many easier. It speeds up the prototyping and testing process for engineers and allows artists to create a new medium of art digitally. CAD also has many other uses in other fields, such as interior designing and healthcare, to name a few. CAD is also being used with other concepts like nanotechnology to maximize the potential. It will be a field that will continue to grow for many years, and it might soon become a tool that everyone will want to have. In the future, every family may have a 3D printer, like they have a regular printer. CAD and 3D printing will continue to create innovations and make many lives easier, whether you use them professionally or as a hobbyist.
