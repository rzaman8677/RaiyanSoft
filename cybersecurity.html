    <h1 class="articleTitle">Cybersecurity</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="cybersecurity.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>The significance of cybersecurity is becoming more and more obvious as technology develops and spreads. Cybersecurity is the defense against threats from malicious actors who frequently use the internet to steal or modify sensitive information. Hackers are now more skilled than ever before and can compromise websites and systems in a matter of minutes. Companies and organizations must give cybersecurity expenditures and measures top priority because the number of potential attack channels will only increase. As a safeguard against the compromise of private and sensitive data, cybersecurity is fast becoming a crucial component of information technology and data management. Companies must be proactive in taking security precautions for their systems, networks, and data due to the growing reliance on technology in daily life and commercial operations. This necessitates a multi-layered strategy that includes expenditures on technology, instruction, and labor.
    </p>
    <p>There are many scams out there that companies are working to combat. One of the biggest ones is phishing. Phishing attacks are usually meant for stealing sensitive information, like login credentials. These scams work by the scammer sending information that appears to be from a credible source or company. You might have already seen these scams through your email, where they claim that you owe loads of money and pretend to be some credible company, like TD Ameritrade. One of the main ways companies combat phishing scams is by educating their employees on how to identify them. The main things they tell their employees is that you can usually spot spelling mistakes in these scams, and the email is usually a little off from the credible one. Additionally, companies tell their employees that they should always be cautious of emails asking for personal information. If the cybercriminal can trick the employee, companies have multi-factor authentication systems, creating an extra step that scammers need to get through. Some companies even use anti-phishing technology to prevent this scam. This software uses an algorithm to determine the legitimacy of the email by looking at the sender, the information, and any external files or links to ensure the email is not a scam. If the software detects it as a scam, it will automatically delete it to ensure the employee does not get confused or tricked. Another popular cybercrime is distributed denial of service(DDoS). The purpose of a DDoS attack is to make a website or product unavailable to customers. Hackers can DDoS someone by overloading a website or server, or product with artificial traffic, exceeding the capacity the product can handle. One of the popular ways companies approach this issue is a cloud-based solution, load balancers. Load balancers can distribute traffic among the servers, preventing a single server from being overwhelmed. They are extremely adaptable, so once it detects a change in patterns, they can quickly adjust and redirect the traffic to other sources. Another way that companies can stop DDoS attacks is traffic filtering which blocks malicious traffic based on the user’s IP address, traffic patterns, ports, and other factors that can make a user seem suspicious. Another way is to use traffic scrubbing, which does the same thing as blocking malicious users, but it does it differently. It can work the same way by looking at IP addresses and ports but by rate limiting and traffic normalization. Rate limiting, in simple terms, is limiting the number of requests an IP address can make on the server. Traffic normalization is a method to remove anomalies in the traffic pattern of a server. Other ways to prevent DDoS attacks are to use firewalls and use network traffic management tools to monitor and control the network to prevent such attacks. The last major cybercrime we are going to discuss is SQL injections. The purpose of SQL injection attacks is to get sensitive information from a company’s database. They work by hackers trying to inject malicious SQL statements into a database. They are mostly done through input fields on a company’s website. One of the ways companies combat SQL injections is to use form validation, which is where you put requirements on the input before it can be submitted, like a character requirement. Companies can also use parameterized queries where you use pre-prepared statements instead of directly inserting a user’s input in SQL statements. Additionally, companies can use web applications firewalls, which can monitor and block suspicious SQL statements based on a set of rules. Companies also can regularly update their databases. 
</p>
    <p>Ultimately there are way more types of scams that exist. Companies cannot account for all of them, so they must find ways to block potential scams and hacks. Companies need to continue to invest heavily in cybersecurity. Although it can be costly, it can save a lot more trouble in the future. As technology advances more and more, cybersecurity will continue to become a major field that needs attention. We need to continue to ensure the companies that run our economy are safe, so you should consider learning more about cybersecurity and even getting a job in the field, as it is one to stay for many years. </p>
