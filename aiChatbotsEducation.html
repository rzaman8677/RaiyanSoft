    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>2023 is the year of artificial intelligence(AI) chatbots. The hype of AI chatbots started with ChatGPT. ChatGPT is an AI chatbot made by OpenAI, a company co-founded by mega-billionaire Elon Musk. AI chatbots have existed for quite a while before with store chatbots, but no AI was available to everyone like ChatGPT. AI chatbots are bots that use machine learning algorithms to respond to requests made. Their response is designed to be human-like. You can understand them better by learning about neural networks. These chatbots have sky-high potential if used correctly. Many schools and teachers have been noticing the increase in the use of AI chatbots. AI chatbots have a lot of power but can be easily misused by students. We are going to be analyzing the use of AI chatbots in the education field and the positives and drawbacks. 
    </p>
    <p>To start, we have to realize that AI chatbots are here to stay. It is extremely difficult to regulate such technologies, so teachers and schools cannot expect them to go away. They cannot monitor everything kids do at home. And even if it was possible to get rid of AI chatbots, it could cause more harm than good. There are many uses and benefits students can face from AI chatbots.
    </p>
    <p>One of the main drawbacks that teachers have with AI chatbots is cheating. You can easily prompt some AI chatbots like ChatGPT to write your essays. There are some tools designed to detect essays generated by AI chatbots, but it makes a teacher’s job ten times more complex. Even if you detected an essay as being generated by ChatGPT, you cannot confirm that. No AI detection system is a hundred percent accurate. People could write in the same style as these chatbots. For example, someone I know wrote an answer to a discussion prompt, and he put it in software meant to detect ChatGPT-generated essays called GPT-2 Output Detector, and it said that he wrote the prompt with the chatbot, but he did not. You cannot accuse someone of using an AI chatbot without definite proof because there is no way to confirm whether or not they did with complete certainty. The only thing teachers could argue is plagiarism, but this generation of kids has all the tools to ensure that their paper has no plagiarism. This is a huge problem, but it could be countered. For starters, teachers and schools cannot control what tools students use, so teachers need to be creative. But they could assign students with assignments for writing essays at school. Many schools have blocked many AI chatbots, and teachers can use tools to monitor students during school. But there are problems with this solution. Teachers will have less time to teach other things. The better solution would be to discourage students from using these chatbots to cheat and let them know it will catch up to them if they continue cheating because, ultimately, it will. When these students get jobs, they cannot continue relying on AI chatbots to cheat their way through work, especially if it is a hands-on job. Another approach that could be used is changing the grading system. Students cheat because they want to be successful and get good grades. Education should not be to assess students' performance but to teach students and help them learn and gain real-life skills. But now, let us explore why AI chatbots can be especially helpful for students. 
</p>
    <p>Although there are still problems for teachers and schools, AI chatbots could also do more good. Like many people have said before, this generation of kids has so many resources that were not present before during the days before the internet. But even with search engines, it is still difficult to find what you want, especially if it is something specific. AI chatbots can help hasten the research process for students, so they can write higher-quality essays with more resources to use. Finding resources should not be a concern for a student. It should be about learning a concept and applying it and explaining it in their writings or using the words of others to support their thoughts. And teachers are not always with students. When students are struggling with something like a math problem, they can ask the AI to explain how to solve it or walk through the problem, so they can learn how to solve such types of problems. Additionally, whether we admit it or not, not all teachers are that great at teaching or do not put in the effort, so it can be useful to learn how to by using an AI chatbot instead of needing to get a tutor. 
    </p>
    <p>AI chatbots have their fair share of problems, but I feel it is more on the education system for making it feel like you need high grades to succeed. These tools are powerful and can transform a student's knowledge. It makes it a hundred times easier to learn. AI chatbots should continue to be used as an assistive tool for students to learn and grow. Students should, however, be aware that AI chatbots have bias and take everything with a grain of salt, but if used correctly, AI chatbots can transform the education sector.
