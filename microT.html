      <h1 class="articleTitle">How Microtransactions Have Affected Gaming</h1>
      <img class="articleImage" src="gaming.webp">
      <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Dylan Chang</b><br>A big fan of gaming and arts.</p>
      <p>Video games have been a part of many people's daily lives for decades, providing an escape from the stresses and challenges of the world we live in. They offer unique experiences that can be cherished for a lifetime and are enjoyed by people of all ages. However, if you take a closer look at the modern video game industry, it can be difficult to find a spark of creativity. Many games seem to be copies of each other, and even the highly anticipated triple AAA games often feel like annual iterations with little new content. It seems that the companies and leaders in the video game industry are more focused on making money than on providing enjoyable experiences for players. One tactic they use to extract money from customers is microtransactions, which can leave players feeling unsatisfied with their purchases and trapped in a cycle of spending. It's not just the microtransactions that can be frustrating for players - the industry as a whole can often feel predatory, with games designed to keep players hooked and spending money for as long as possible. The video game industry must prioritize the enjoyment and satisfaction of players, rather than just focusing on financial gain. Without a focus on creativity and innovation, the industry risks losing the passion and loyalty of its customers. The video game industry has the potential to be a source of joy and entertainment for millions of people, but companies need to remember that their customers are human beings, not just sources of income. After all, their customers are the ones who build the game's community up and are the reason for any game's success. Without the customer and the community, video games are nothing but an honest attempt at a money grab.</p>
      <br>
      <p>To start, what exactly is a microtransaction? Microtransactions are financial transactions done in a video game. The first big microtransaction sold was in 2006 in the video game “The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,” published by Bethesda. They sold horse armor to players for $2.50, which had no effect on gameplay and was purely cosmetic. Most players responded negatively to this microtransaction to the point where it is one of the biggest memes on the internet to this day. Despite this reaction, the horse armor was successful, becoming the ninth best-selling DLC (Downloadable Content) in “The Elder Scrolls LV: Oblivion.” Following this success, more and more games began adding microtransactions to their game as another way of making a profit. In 2009 Facebook released Farmville, a game simulating an agriculture career. The game would have you do things such as planting seeds, harvesting crops, and plowing the land to enhance your virtual farm. The challenge was keeping your virtual farm alive. If not diligent enough, your crops would wither and die after a certain period of time. Fortunately, Farmville made Farm Cash to purchase abilities such as “unwither” that would keep your virtual farm from dying. Farm Cash could only be bought with real money, meaning that if you truly wanted to succeed, you would have to purchase these abilities with real money. Games using microtransactions that affect gameplay in a way that rewards players with a higher chance of success have come to be known as “pay-to-win” games. Pay-to-win games like FarmVille or cosmetic microtransactions like the horse armor in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion are on practically every game on every platform. Many games have taken this even further and made it their only source of revenue.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As more games started to utilize microtransactions, the focus of companies shifted to implementing microtransactions for maximum profit. Video game industries have been scrambling to create an appealing game for their players to pay real money for in-game items that will aid them in their adventure. Before purchasing and downloading games through the internet became popular, you would typically be required to go to the store to purchase the game. Someone would buy a video game for the regular price and get the entire game. Now, if you were to buy a game at the regular price, you would not even get the full game. Games that have a “one-time” purchase or are even free but encourage players to buy more content that, without them, may not be even to complete the entire game are known as “freemium” games. With video game industries prioritizing the quantity of content to create the maximum amount of revenue instead of the creativity and quality of the video game, games have deteriorated in their ability to be art and a great tool for storytelling. They have now become tools for private industries to make as much money off their customers as possible with empty promises of new and refreshing ideas instead of giving us the innovation and creativity we need in the gaming industry.
