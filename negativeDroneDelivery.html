    <img class="articleImage" src="drone2.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>Drones are an up-and-coming technology, and they are starting to get more commercial use. They used to be just for hobbyists and military use, but they have expanded. One of the most promising places that drones are starting to be used is for deliveries. At first glance, it sounds great and easy. You get your packages faster, and it helps the environment, but there is more than that to it. It is not as easy as it sounds, and there are plenty of barriers that we have to break. In this article, we are going to explore the challenges and negatives of using drones for deliveries. 
    </p>
    <p>There are many challenges to implementing drone technology for deliveries, but one stands out the most. Do companies have the technology to create autonomous drones? We already have seen many errors with electric cars, so it will be interesting to see how it will go for drones. But luckily for drones, they do not have to navigate traffic or people, but they can also be more dangerous. Imagine the drone collided with a bird or a tree and fell. If it hit you, it would hurt, assuming drones fly from pretty high heights, but that does not factor in the package weight, which could be something like a weight. It could kill someone and make people scared to even walk outside. Even if it is a rare occurrence, people will be scared justifiably. Another risk that could reside is cyber attacks. With this generation of hackers, nothing is safe, so imagine if someone goes in control of one of the drones. We would not want flashbacks to tragic events. Additionally, there is always the scare of failure. Having something at such high heights fail is frightening. Another issue is the grip of the drone. Imagine the drone just dropped your package or fell and hit something. But a concern that might scare away companies is theft. The drone cannot drop a package from a height to prevent theft, or the package could break, so it will go to ground level, meaning thieves could steal them. Additionally, drones are not that large, so companies cannot deliver many packages at a time, and drones do not have unlimited charges, so companies will constantly need to charge their drones. Drones will also not be able to deliver packages that far because of this same reason unless we create drone charging stations. Another issue is bad weather, as it might affect or damage the drone. Drones can also collide with things, causing more damage. This means companies will need to spend money on repairs and maintenance and perhaps retrieving drones. Additionally, there are plenty of areas with no drone zones, so companies cannot deliver packages everywhere, or they might have to take a longer route. But those are not the only problems. Drones will cause the loss of many people's jobs. Drones could also interfere with wildlife and their habitats with sound pollution or collisions. Drones could also bother humans with their noise, especially at night. They could also interfere with air traffic, affecting the route of planes and other aircraft and potentially damaging the aircraft. It will also make aircraft management one hundred times harder than it already is. Additionally, another issue is battery disposal. If not done right, the batteries could cause harm to the environment and make you question their environmentally friendly nature. Another big issue is what does the drone do if it cannot reach its destination? Does the drone react in a proper manner? Imagine someone ordered a package on the tenth floor of a building. Does the drone drop the package, or does it try flying through the building, or what else does it do? Another issue that might be the most concerning for people is privacy and security. Drones will have to use cameras to navigate around autonomously, like an autonomous vehicle. With those cameras, people lose a sense of privacy and can pose security threats if the companies save the recordings. It does not affect just the customer but everyone else, including their neighbors and the public. Another issue is a political issue. Countries might think of the drone as a spy drone and decide to shoot it down, which could cause controversy between the countries. There are plenty of challenges for drones.
    </p>
    <p>Using drones for deliveries is an intriguing, innovative idea. It may sound easy and completely perfect but is not. The attention of the companies might be good, but drones come with unconsidered consequences. There are plenty of hurdles that need to be overcome. Some of the most critical ones are privacy, loss of jobs, collisions, malfunctions, and hacking. While there are plenty of issues, I believe that we should continue exploring the technology and fixing the issues, as it is an innovative technology that could do more good than bad if done correctly.
