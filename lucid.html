    <h1 class="articleTitle">About Lucid Motors</h1>
    <img class="articleImage" src="lucid.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>A big fan of sports and technology.</p>
    <p>Lucid Motors was founded in 2007 by Bernard Tse, Sam Weng, and Sheaupyng Lin. It originally was a battery supplier with the name of Atieva, but it would later become restructured into an electric car company under CEO Peter Rawlinson, former chief engineer of the Tesla Model S. Peter left Tesla citing reasons such as bad treatment by his manager, referring to Tesla's CEO Musk, and the need to take care of his ill mom (Chokshi, Ewing).</p>
    <p>But it would take quite a bit more than Peter to aid Lucid in its revamp. Lucid got assistance from the Saudi Public Investment Fund(PIF) to help construct their factory in Casa Grande, Arizona. The PIF is also Lucid's largest shareholder, holding over 1.1 billion shares, which is over 60 percent of the company (Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia).</p>
    <p>Lucid started the delivery of cars at the end of October 2021 (Lucid Motors). The first model Lucid developed and sold was the Lucid Air Dream Edition, priced at 169,000 dollars, with a limited quantity of 520. The reason for such an odd number is that the Lucid Air Dream edition had 520 miles of range, which was the highest ever for an electric car before Lucid created a new version of the Lucid Air Dream exclusive to Europe. The Lucid Air Dream is a luxury car that is built for not only comfort but also luxury. The build material and design are world-class, on top of the impressive speed and range.</p>
    <p>Even with such a car, the first year for Lucid was a struggle, as they only managed to produce 400 cars in quarter 4 of 2021 and only delivered 125 after anticipation that all the Lucid Air Dream Editions would be delivered in that time, but there were some positives as Lucid won the motor trend car of the year (InsideEVs).</p>
    <p>Things did not get much better in the first half of 2022, as the company only managed to produce 1,405 vehicles which was significantly lower than their yearly outlook of about 20 thousand cars (Lucid Motors). The struggles were cited as supply chain issues with glass and carpet (Lucid Motors). They were forced to reduce their goals from 20 thousand to 12 thousand and finally to 6 thousand. As a result of all this struggle, Lucid's stock went down incredible amounts, but on the bright side, Lucid was able to start production of the Lucid Air Grand Touring and established a partnership with NVIDIA. They even got a 100 thousand car order from Saudi Arabia, but they remained, burning high amounts of cash.</p>
    <p>Things would get significantly better in quarter 3 of 2022, as Lucid was able to reveal the Lucid Air Sapphire, the fastest production car in the world, accelerating from 0-60 miles in under 2 seconds and 0-100 in under 4 seconds. Lucid also managed to produce 2,282 cars in quarter 3 of 2022, putting them on pace to exceed their goal. Some say that this increase in production is due to the firing of some high-level executives.</p>
    <p>Lucid, in addition, had great success at the end of 2022, as they revealed the Lucid Air Gravity and raised around 1.5 billion in investments, but the stock is still falling, and the company seems to be struggling to deliver cars with their greatly increased production, but they seem to be on track of their goals. Overall, Lucid has a bright future. Lucid has world-class technology, if not the best, so as long as Lucid keeps rapidly expanding production, it will be fine. In addition, Lucid needs to create a cheaper car, which their CEO has said will be coming in 2025 (Lucid Insider). The need for a lower-priced car is magnified by Tesla. Their sales are mostly from their two cheaper models, the Model 3 and Y. In addition, Lucid needs to continue global expansion and bring in customers worldwide. If Lucid can continue to do these things, it could potentially overtake Tesla as the highest-valued electric car and car company. It should also be easier now with Tesla's CEO Elon Musk in all these controversies and his focus removed from solely Tesla. But again, Lucid Motors should not be seen as a car company, but as a software company. Lucid and Tesla are in a tech race.</p>
