    <img class="articleImage" src="asteroid.webp">
    <p class="articleAuthor"><b>By Raiyan Zaman</b><br>An aspiring engineer and computer scientist.</p>
    <p>Asteroids, small rocks measuring meters to kilometers in diameter, are capable of causing plenty of damage and are a source of major concern for scientists. We have come in contact with many asteroids over many years. We have roughly been safe from the severe impacts that these asteroids are capable of, but how long are we safe? We need to do something to prevent the risk of asteroid collisions in the future. How may we do this, you may ask. Maybe let us think about this like a three-year-old. How about we crash into the asteroid? Or could we use the gravitational pull of spacecraft or shoot a nuclear weapon at them? These are all some ways that we could stop an asteroid. Scientists are actively searching for the best way and are doing plenty of testing and experiments. This article will explore the different ways that scientists are planning to use to stop asteroids from causing catastrophic damage to our home planet. 
    </p>
    <p>The first step necessary before trying to stop an asteroid is to find the asteroid with the potential for disaster. Asteroids can be detected using a ground-based telescope with optical imaging. We could also use the better solution of a space-based observing system that uses infrared imaging to search for asteroids. These systems can detect asteroids too faint to be detected by ground-based telescopes, and they can provide us with more detail on the size, speed, and trajectory of an asteroid. Once the data is collected, scientists can use the information to calculate the asteroid's orbit to determine whether a collision is possible. This mathematical process involves calculating the Earth's trajectory and comparing it to the asteroid's trajectory. We can also use radar observations to determine the size, shape, rotation, and other physical characteristics. Once we have this information, we can determine which asteroids we need to prioritize and how exactly to remove the asteroid from its current trajectory. 
    </p>
    <p>One of the ways that scientists propose is to shoot nuclear weapons at asteroids. The thinking behind this process is that the explosive power of a nuclear bomb could alter the asteroid's trajectory. Although this approach seems relatively genius, it has drawbacks. Shooting a nuke at an asteroid could break the asteroid into smaller pieces and increase its impact on Earth. If something goes wrong, the force of the nuke could change the trajectory to hit Earth. There could also be political and diplomatic implications of using nukes, which could violate international treaties and lead to war. Another worry is that this approach may be ineffective depending on the size, velocity, and composition of the asteroid, and we would have to use more force. Although nukes sound like a good idea, it is more of a last resort if all else fails. 
    </p>
    <p>A more practical solution would be using a non-nuclear kinetic impactor. We could send a spacecraft to crash with an asteroid at high speeds, changing the asteroid's velocity, which changes the asteroid's trajectory. This approach would rely on the spacecraft's mass and velocity and whether it is high enough to change the asteroid's path. This approach would prevent diplomatic problems and would be less likely to break the asteroid into smaller pieces. The problem with this approach is that it will take high accuracy and timing. It will also be costly and has limitations based on the size, velocity, and composition of the asteroid. 
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps the most promising method is a gravitational tractor, which uses the gravitational attraction between a spacecraft and an asteroid to change the trajectory. The spacecraft would be designed to fly close to the asteroid and use its gravitational pull. The gravitational pull would be small, but it would be continuous, allowing the change of the trajectory of the asteroid. This approach would be more likely to be effective, but it will require time. This approach is also the cheapest one because you are not destroying the spaceship, so you can reuse it, but it has limitations like the rest. It might be ineffective if you do not have enough pull and time, and you may need multiple spacecraft. 
    </p>
    <p>We are actively trying to find ways to stop asteroids to prevent catastrophic danger. Scientists are identifying the potential asteroid collisions and how long we will have to stop them. There are many methods out there, like a nuclear kinetic impactor, a kinetic impactor, and a gravitational tractor. They all have their positives and drawbacks, but these approaches all show plenty of promise at the end of the day. The most promising one is the gravitational tractor, as it is reusable and has fewer variables, but it may not be the best approach. The best approach may be to use a combination of these methods and not a particular one. We will continue to research ways to stop asteroids and hopefully save our planet from future collisions and become heroes.
